61,61,this isnt one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology or being dated issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with but rather a review on the story telling which most of us are truly interested in the plot is about a combination of wwii allied and german navy members and two civilians the hero and heroine who are thrust together on a german u boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs the manipulations arent so bad by film standards and we know from the plot that realism isnt going to be high what films like this need are credible and likable characters along with some semblance of reason in the actions this film lacks both for a full length film only 6 characters are given any time and 3 of them are barely looked into mcclures hero is beyond routine and doesnt make much sense in any era the female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered but the riddle is not much of a riddle and we could care less a lot of failure in a film that should have been better even for its time,0,0,theres simply no redeeming quality about this film ok some of the costumes are ok but theyre nothing you cant see in say the conan flicks and whats up with ators hair i cant believe this is part of a series i will say one thing about this film it was deemed bad enough for a righteous lampooning by the early cast of mst3k and i suggest to anyone thats curious enough to see how bad this film is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else,0,0
70,70,the first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts the  thematic  conflict between the soldier todd and his suppressed humanity and the  physical  conflict between todd and his bio engineered replacement both sequences are quite gripping in different ways peoples screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half way through the movie which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp nonetheless kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell who conveys much with very little not a great film but one worth seeing,1,1,a real hoot unintentionally sidney portiers character is so sweet and lovable you want to smack him nothing about this movie rings true and its boring to boot,0,0
63,63,lars von triers europa is an extremely good film hows that von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with europa to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list i also think it is perhaps the scariest the most gothic and complete film around all right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever,1,1,ill tempered verbally abusive movie studio chief runs his male assistant ragged with nit picking requests keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment after a year of office terror the working stiff finally cracks writer director george huang has possibly bit off more than he can chew here his swimming with sharks isnt a diatribe against hollywood nor is it a tribute to the hard working underlinginstead its stunt film making with a twist a one trick pony with tunnel vision the surroundings dont look or feel like tinsel town perhaps due to a limited budget and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a movie making entity it could be a realtors office in the valley for all we know lead kevin spacey who also served as one of the films producers gives a controlled and focused performance as the power mad mogul whose ego is out of control he does good work and yet the character doesnt ring true we learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high ranking status fail to jibe with what we do see who does this man answer to what drives him beyond humiliating others for sport what projects is he juggling aside from the one script we see passed around the film is so emotionally stunted and underpopulated it begins to seem like a stage play padded out for the big screen  and yet one without enough characters or motivations in it perhaps huang wanted to keep things simple but instead his movie looks like a half baked project which needed a lot more insight humor and atmosphere ** from ****,0,0
33,33,the story would never win awards but thats not what its about the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes who needs a story with fighting like that really its worth watching for that reason alone if you can handle the gore of which there is a lot none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at i gave it a 7,1,0,it may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to phoolan devi herself and when she did finally see parts of it was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in india or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself i do not know whether it was shown at all or not but given her standing at the time as a rising politician i doubt it since then i saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her dacoit days and has gone into hiding as a result her own concerns aside this is an excellent film made all the more so by its refreshingly brutal approach none of the rose tinted melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film it should be stressed that concerns about how feminist the films messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant its a true story her misgivings are it seems not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her,1,1
8,8,a series of random seemingly insignificant thefts at her sisters boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated a ring light bulbs a rucksack a lighter a stethoscope a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it miss lemon asks her employer the great belgian detective hercule poirot to look into the matter but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined and poirots fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered its up to poirot to bring a killer to justice hickory dickory dock is a solid but not spectacular entry in the long running poirot series i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christies original story i realize that certain liberties had to be taken but i appreciate the effort nonetheless the major points of the mystery are all there  the petty thefts the boarding house the students the ripped rucksack and of course poirots ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens with a few exceptions the cast of students is almost as i pictured them damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group as mush as i always enjoy david suchets poirot i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jacksons inspector japp and pauline morans miss lemon this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual finally i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel its a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock title i realized while re watching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christies work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films or gialli of the 60s and 70s take the murder of mrs nicoletis as an example if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo in fact the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo its just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked,1,1,i found this movie really hard to sit through my attention kept wandering off the tv as far as romantic movies gothis one is the worst ive seen dont bother with it,0,0
41,41,this is a story of the winchester rifle model 1873 the gun that won the west to cowman outlaw peace officer or soldier the winchester 73 was a treasured possession an indian would sell his soul to own one winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director anthony mann and actor james stewart a duo that would go on to create a run of superior westerns that added a new psychological depth to the genre the story sees stewart as lin mcadam pursuing the man who killed his father riding into dodge city with his trusty friend johnny williams {millard mitchell} lin runs into dutch henry brown {stephen mcnally} the man he wants but with wyatt earp {will geer} having taken all the guns from those entering the town both men are unable to have the shoot out that they are ready for the men instead square up in a competition to win a winchester 73 rifle a competition that lin eventually wins but before he can leave town with the magnificent prize dutch ambushes him steals the rifle and skips town fast as lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle the rifle will changed hands a number of times with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches very much a benchmark for what became known as the so called psychological western winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past tho shot in black and white {the only one of the duos westerns that was} the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes the tone is set with the opening scene as lin and johnny on horseback and in silhouette amble over a hillside as they make their way to dodge city its just the starting point that would see mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as mcadam proving once and for all that he was one of americas finest and most versatile actors the support cast isnt too bad either shelley winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo while mitchell mcnally geer and the always great dan duryea add further class to proceedings theres even bit parts for tony curtis and rock hudson in here tho the latter playing an indian brave is a stretch too far originally the film was a project for fritz lang who even had the script ready to run but lang walked away from it something that proved to be a blessing for western fans for as great as a director that lang was with mann directing {and with a new script from borden chase & robert richards in hands} it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre not only with the further efforts that mann & stewart produced but also in who they influenced the likes of budd boetticher nicholas ray and sam fuller were all taking notes and gleefully for the western purists they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further a big hit at the box office back on release winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age 95 10,1,1,walt was particularly fond of quality so how come the producers at disney would release such a terribly edited roughly acted even for family fare mess of a movie the big green had a good concept and since it is disney you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously but the big green is horrible the jokes are lame and steve guttenburg still alive pulls in another terrible performance on his resume kids with too much time on their hands in small town elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer the kids dont know a thing though and gracious for us we get to see steve guttenburg try to hit on the teacher from beginning to end the speed up camera work does not work the big green is full of speeding the pace of characters to move the movie along kids are not idiots they will catch on if you give them enough of a hint without showing all that garbage guttenburg for once in his life should have turned down an offer to join this movie also the pretty olivia dabo should have called this one off too the big green can be known as the big bomb,0,0
73,73,i first saw blood of the samurai at its premiere during the hawaii international film festival wow blood just blew us away with its sheer verve gore vitality gore excitement gore utter campiness and even more gore and all in such great fun especially for those of you who enjoy all those japanese chambara samurai and ninja films you definitely have to see blood,1,1,an especially delightful film to those of us who saw this when young because after all it was meant for the young to watch   when viewing it again as an adult its better if rose tinted spectacles can kick in it was the first of the 16 jungle jim films and later tv series chunky johnny weismuller went on to do for columbia in the last 3 films he had to use his own name though as theyd lost the rights after getting the sack from playing tarzan for sol lesser johnny sheffield also gave up playing boy to become bomba the jungle boy in a series of 12 films jim and party go on perilous safari to hunt down the hidden temple of zimbalu manned by an obscure tribe of devil doctors who seem to have the secret of a poison that might also be a cure for polio edgar rice burroughs probably approved after 16 years talking monosyllabically weismuller seemed awkward stringing sentences together not that it mattered on the swift march we meet many of the interesting but generally playful denizens of the jungle barring the sinister crocodile going to eat the leading lady with her leg caught under a twig and the surreal elephant stampede stock footage squeezed into a corner of the frame skipper the dog and caw caw the crow had many adventures none of which turned out essential to the plot in case you were concentrating the biggest problem with the film is the farcical climax which can be exciting but also unfortunately remind you of the end of a serial part  and the original excellent serial had been made 12 years prior although personally i wouldnt have minded this going on another couple of hours as well the only thing heavy about this was weismuller in so many ways an enjoyable kids film from the old days   not recommended for serious adults so i love it,1,1
35,35,for daniel auteuil `queen margot was much better for nastassja kinski `paris texas was much better the biggest disappointments were from chris menges `crisscross and `a world apart cannot even be compared with this one and goran bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from `queen margot for this movie attention to the end of the film if this was an american pop movie i would not feel surprised at all but for a european film with more independent actors and director a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple minded and disappointing there are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people there are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone and finally there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys every character is shown in simple black and white terms the good versus the evil plus from the very beginning i could understand how the story would end is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse i believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie i think this movie was not disturbing but very disappointing,0,0,i was a still photographer working in europe the summer that jim salter shot the movie three i did some swell pictures for him one of which i was told became the poster for the movie i didnt see the film until years later i thought it was bad a pity because the elements that went into it were compelling robie porters girlfriend was almast as beautiful as rampling herself salter asked if i would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldnt have to shoot everything twice i said sure but i had to return to ny promising id be back alas i never did get back one of lifes unsung melodies i wish i could post the pictures i made somewhere rowland scherman,0,1
32,32,an ultra modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre and deadly behavior or at least that is what lara flynn boyles character col kennedy argues after a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door col knows something has got to give mark paul gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect my opinion the house next door works because of lara flynn boyle and the locations beautiful house and stylish sets boyle is a talented and dynamic actress not to mention absolutely stunning she brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing without her it would have failed its so alive declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house yes it is alive but the story itself is not so much barring boyles presence not much is happening here as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners the results are predictable but i liked it anyway the cinematography lends the film a polished look 8 10 on account of boyle the premise of an evil ultra modern house the locations and cinematography and set decoration and wardrobe,1,1,directed by the same jin ishimoto that put neoedision and flixercom a once promising online film community temporarily out of business and off the net because of his directorial style and method of filmmaking on his next film girls best friend the hole suffers from this look at me i am a filmmaker style of filmmaking that is becoming the near standard in todays hollywood to the detriment of content the hole actually starts out with a unique concept but that concept and the promise of captivating content soon is destroyed by the look at me directorial style of filmmaking there are some funny moments that still shine through the pretense but it is a painful short to watch how sad it is when the new breed of filmmakers choose not to be a servant to the story but rather try and dominant on and off screen heck they dont care as long as they get their studio deal house on the beach and a new car content and presentation are secondary issues the real sad part of all this is hollywood embraces the look at me attitude so much that the whole aesthetic of filmmaking is changing rather than present a story in a straightforward way that puts the story first todays directors are getting experimental ie look at me is it me or am i the only one that was really put off by senas opening minutes of swordfish that movie went on to rise above senas directorial attempts at look at me filmmaking unfortunately this short film by mr ishimoto does not 3 out of 10 rating from elec tv,0,0
36,36,as i write this review in 2008 we are mired in a remake culture movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including king kong the wicker man and practically every film that ever starred michael caine this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon however as dough for the do do proves an entirely pointless colorized version of bob clampetts surreal masterpiece porky in wackyland dough for the do do sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over clampetts original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by friz freleng freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with clampetts source material although in truth no director could hope to come close to clampetts inspired insanity inevitably then dough for the do do is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached for cartoon fans like myself its equivalent to a colorization of casablanca,0,0,return to me is a charming gem of a movie with an absolutely star studded cast who can go wrong with this modern day fairy tale it also includes many many jokes written by the funny girl herself bonnie hunt who wrote and directed this film david duchovny is also very good showing a different approach then from his everday alter ego mulder on my favourite show the x files a great date movie,1,1
