19,19,i had to give this film a 1 because its that bad but dont make this think that i didnt enjoy watching because i laughed and laughed and i even had a few questions so half of the time i was laughing half of the time i was saying what in the hell is going on or why would someone do this et cetera i mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects the 80s style nude scene battle dialogue nude scene and the way that the warriors swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses and theres some crappy model effects those arent supposed to be real trees are they and i still dont understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he a friend of mine told me about these movies and i thought i would give em a try and i basically liked the film as people like ed wood films i have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be i look at it in my own hilarious way so dont let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie it is i just liked it for other reasons its much much worse than evil dead so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it which came into my mind a few times i guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks have some friends around and laugh at this film maybe this is a bit harsh but i dont think so rent it and youll see yo,0,0,this is the battlefield earth of mini series it has with a few exceptions all the disastrous ingredients that doomed that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery they are both adaptations of books with a endless amount of pages who has been turned to a complete mess by a script writer and a director in this case they are the same person who clearly dont know what they are doing they have both a messiah wannabe that dont really deliver as a hero played in this case by a guy that looks like mark hamill but sadly the force is not with him and a bunch of stupid bad guys who likes to betray and mess up the life for each other they are both containing scenes stolen from better productions and they are both cheap productions who tries to look expensive with some often badly made computer animation the exceptions that actually makes the whole thing worse is the terrible work made by the lighting guy who dont even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room the camera work that for no reasons at all sometimes are in tilted battlefield earth mode but for the most of the time are flat as a pancake the extremely cheap and to small desert set that only contents a pile of sand in the front of a backdrop painted as a desert that turns very old very fast because it appears in almost every scene and the bad idea by the costume designer to try to mimic the fifth elements fashion madness with the addition of the silliest hats ever made silly moments to remember 1 every scene with the guild guys who looks like mst3ks observer guys but with silly hats 2 irulan shows up at the party dressed in her butterfly dress why butterflys  was the one with stuffed parrots in the cleaner with matching silly hat together with a couple of guys with silly balloon hats 3 paul the stand up comedian 4 baron harkonnen in over acting overdrive screaming im alive 5 every scene with the backdrop because it newer fits the foreground 6 every scene with the fremens fake religious cermonies specially the water of life cermony 7 the battle scenes where the same guys gets killed a couple times and the same things explodes over and over again it is a lot more but it is a 1000 words limit on this so i better stop before i gets carried away,0,0
53,53,i anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the broadway play i waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances i mean with the star power of eddie murphy jamie foxx beyonce knowles danny glover the movie couldnt be less than 4 out of 4 stars right wrong i was definitely disappointed by the finished product the film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were eddie murphy anika noni rose and jennifer hudson eddie murphys james brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and jennifer hudsons performance compels you to pay attention each time shes on screen her performance of and i am telling you was the only time that i felt the hype was deserved you cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life as many reviewers have stated she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades shes receiving for this performance anika noni rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent  jamie foxx and beyonce knowles on the other hand cruised through their performances foxxs acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary ray performance and beyonce knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping posing and shimmying her way through the movie her performance wasnt strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film the movie was too hyped 30 minutes and 1 song beyonces heartfelt solo to jamie foxx too long dh    vancouver wa,0,0,my first ichikawa in many years and the first of his war films that ive seen this was gripping and brutal from the very get go in the very first scene nominal hero tamura is told that he cant continue on with his unit to which he has returned from the hospital he apparently has tb  but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him given the quantity of war wounded they have but his old unit wont take him back either his co gives him a grenade and tells him that if he feels truly hopeless to blow himself upits the honorable thing to do the phillipines 1945 and the situation really does seem hopeless for pfc tamura and everyone else nobi is an odyssey through hell or rather hells  denuded forests dead rocky plains and the dead and dying japanese soldiers hoping just for an end through peace or death ichikawas film is photographed in stunning b&w scope which serves to highlight both the desolation felt by tamura and those he meets on his journey towards his doom and to show how truly small and naked they all are amidst the immensity of the mountains and the foreststhis small affair of humans will end soon the earth seems to be saying but i will survive and barely notice it tamura travels back towards the hospital but is not surprisingly rejected there and spends the rest of the film trying to stay alive stay human and get out of danger he doesnt manage to do very well on any account slowly starving and eventually committing some fairly repellent acts eventually he hooks up with two other desperate men who have lost or survived their units and have resorted to cannibalismand in his weakened state facing other armed men finds that the only way to live is to break with everything that he believes in ichikawas film is as brutal uncompromising and intense as any war film ive seen there are moments of humor and tenderness but they are fleeting and dont stick in the memory such as the scene with the man on the mountaintop who practically begs tamura to eat his fleshthe recurring black comic bit with tamura exchanging his ragged shoes for the better leathers of a fallen comradethe degradations that humans will endure to survivethe truth that this is any war all wars all mankind as long as we continue thus a masterpiece that i probably wont watch again for a long long time watched via the beautiful criterion collection dvd,1,1
109,109,i dont know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless what about just being entertained something at which morgan freeman excels he gets a chance to show off a bit paz vega his co star gets a career boost and brad silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie i thought it was a good movie some humor some pathos some bittersweetness but nothing over the top i got an especial kick out of jim parsons as the receptionist at a construction company when he looks at freeman adoringly and says you make me want to be a woman hes just hilarious the fight scene between ms vega her ex husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too in short its a cute charming film that will make you smile you could do much much worse,1,1,went with some friends and one of my friends mom thinking it would be a good way to start off the spring break but the movie turned out awful we all agree it shouldnt have been pg 13 more like r material lots of sexual dialog cussing and referring to boy and girl parts below the waist not worth the time or money strongly urge you not to go or rent it when it comes out if you do end up going dont take smaller children not the type of movie to see with the family if curious about the content check out the content advisory section on the superhero movie page on imdb most of the content that was meant to be funny was extremely crude especially when they make fun of steven hawking,0,0

121,121,back in 74 eric monte made the classic tv show good times jj has always been my favorite and i love watching the reruns on tv land jimmie walker always seemed to be the star and not esther rolle john amos most of the time felt a little jealous of jimmie walkers popularity winning millions of fans time to sit and watch good times the show would have been dead if jj wouldt have been there to save it with his always kool aid attitude drinking kool aid was like his favorite thing on the show i was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended instead of 1974 1979 it should have went longer like in the 1980s when i was just growing up,1,1,now let me see if i have this correct a lunatic serial killer is going around murdering estate agentsokaywhats wrong with that scenario i can live with that what next a slasher with tax inspectors butchered traffic wardens sliced to death are we supposed to feel any sympathy for empty headed and shallow money obsessed property people erno sadly joking aside its just not a very well made film with poor acting and crude effects the climatic scene is particularly silly you can almost see the director shouting action to the stuntman as he falls through the glass of the window as another reviewer quite rightly said after starring in the fog this was the nadir of adrienne barbeaus career therefore i was happy to see that she had rekindled it by becoming the voice of catwoman in the batman animated series while watching the extras on the live action catwoman film nb not quite the awful film its made out to be by the way this however is a bad film think a poor episode of kojak or streets of san francisco and you will get an idea of what is on offer here,0,0
46,46,i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute it had all the sex content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra chemistry uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene  both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you cant feel your face anymore anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each others roles perfectly and even wanda sykes rather small role will keep you laughing though these kind of comedies arent for everybody but i have to say i went with a person that doesnt usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy this movie is certainly not for everyone especially younger children since some moments are little toowell lets say adult for younger viewers all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film 3 1 2* out of 5*,1,1,this is sweet the actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays elvira mistress of the dark another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of roy munsin in king pin this is most glorious story ever to be told it should sell more copies than the bible my parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater the movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it the lady who gave the go ahead friend of the family was let go by the theater i was 3 years old i have burned through 4 copies on vhs and finally had it converted to dvd its beautiful,1,1
3,3,i have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me i cannot understand why some people compare this to babe this film is not about the secret life of all animals who secretly can talk instead it is about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner a little girl with a serious stammer overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart wrenching scene early on then the great journey begins paulie the parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend marie along the way he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people he falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her he gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him he recounts his tale to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved marie tony shaloub shines as the kindly janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little paulie despite the risks jay mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across there is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too it is a witty clever epic animal adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl he search for marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who dont know much about parrots kids who have seen the wild green parrot tribes in los angeles and pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds especially parrots are not disposable pets all children everywhere will see that pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured so no babe here more of an incredible journey with a twist enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts,1,1,i saw this movie on a flukei was standing on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this moviei gave it a chance not expecting muchthe promotional movie posters ive seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all the movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metalill leave it therethe movie is a heavy comedy and lots of funif your are old enough to remember when heavy metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this filmjack black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician tenacious d is definitely worth a look,1,1
111,111,flight of fury starts as general tom barnes angus macinnes organises an unofficial test flight of the x 77 a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher steve toussaint the job & everything goes well until the x 77 disappears even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan & delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone vincenzo nicoli who plans to use the x 77 to fly into us airspace undetected & drop some bombs which will kills lots of people general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane & sends in one man army john sands co writer & executive producer steven seagal to get it back & kill all the bad guys in the process this american british & romanian co production was directed by michael keusch & was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man 2006 & attack force 2007 luckily someone decided the partnership wasnt working & an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaborations between the two apparently flight of fury is an almost scene for scene word for word remake of black thunder 1988 starring michael dudikoff with many of the same characters even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder & therefore cannot compare the two flight of fury is a terrible film the poorly made & written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days its boring even though its not that slow the characters are poor its full of clichés things happen at random the plot is poor the reasoning behind events are none existent & its a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed the action scenes are lame & theres no real excitement in it the villains are boring as are the heroes & its right down there with the worst seagal has made flight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isnt even matched up that well the background can change peoples clothes change the area changes the sky & the quality of film changes very abruptly as its all too obvious we are watching clips from other better films spliced in hell seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this the action scenes consist of shoot outs so badly edited its hard to tell who is who & of course seagal breaking peoples arms the whole production feels very cheap & shoddy the imdb reckons this had a budget of about $12000000 which i think is total rubbish i mean if so where did all the money go although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods it was actually shot in romania & the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan the acting is terrible as one would expect & seagal looks dubbed again flight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring amateurish & is an almost scene for scene remake of another film anyway another really lazy & poorly produced action thriller from seagal why do i even bother any more,0,0,this movie is not realistic at all more of a comedy than a serious war film very old fashioned too maybe i was just expecting it to be on a same level with platoon i wonder why 50% of the voters gave it 10 something must be wrong,0,1
25,25,i was electrified when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984 steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten i didnt when finally in south africa in 1993 it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel iafrika my hair stood on its ends there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples,1,1,this classic has so many great one liners and unintentionally hilarious scenes that i dont even know where to start if you want advice on dating its here just totally ignore the person you want and then spout out classic lines like chickens goodi like chicken and before you know it you will be having a one nighter in a basement its a nice basement with a woman who is 35 years younger than you bronson does it all in this film he buys a car for no good reason just so he can murder two gang memberspaying with cashchunnng he buys an ice cream simply because this is america isnt it and ends up wasting someone named the giggler   he laughs when he runs just because he stole his camera by the way this giggler is so fast that bronsons regular pistol cant even catch up to him he needs to order a special one just to get this elusive creep he gets cleaned up just so he can eat a really smelly meal stuffed cabbage in a rat trap with a couple of old people who like to wear heavy clothing in 90 degree weather he goes into the dentistry business he always seems to find a crow bar when he needs one and its the same one and last but not least he always seems to have a rocket launcher at his disposal just in case he needs to blow away richie cunninghams older brother chuck who is now strung out and in dire need of a makeover anyway this will all make sense once you have seen this classicall i can say is enjoy i owed you that one dude,1,0
118,118,this movie features two of my favorite actors in kilmer and downey it also boasts the always enjoyable larry miller in a too small part despite this i found it to be nearly unwatchable michelle monaghan may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for downeys characters obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way its portrayed the ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so fans of the film say that those who disagree simply dont get it i dont think this is so the plot was not complicated or beyond understanding it was simply uninvolving and clumsily and obviously manufactured i got it i just didnt like it paddy breathnachs i went down and guy ritchies snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels are much better realized examples of the kind of film making that director shane black fails to achieve i share a birthday with shane black but a look at his credits mostly as a screenwritermakes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection,0,0,i saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it so charming and so very romantic david duchovny and ms driver have chemistry that is so hot you will need to take off a layer of clothing the supporting cast is 100% top notch just watching caroll oconnor and robert loggia play off one another is pure poetry bonnie hunt and jim bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen like jim belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep forever or him dancing in the kitchen this film made we wish i knew people like that in my own life not to mention what woman does not want david duchovny for a boyfriend,1,1
99,99,i thought it was pretty interesting my social studies language arts teacher was the police chief guy that was holding the microphone on the water barrel part =d i was excited my teacher is in some commercials he was in a gas coffee phone play station commercial its nice seeing him on tv he was also on everybody hates chris except he always get the small part la la why do we have to right 10 lines thats so stupid  _  i think im done never mind im still not done what is this a joke why do we have to go all the way to line ten really whats the point of it i will just right random words for now  _  maple story is fun i love my friends,1,0,my reaction to this remake of the italian job is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when i saw it this is the first movie i saw after i had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining money was still tight but i no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills or eating lunch and the sense of relief and gratitude i was feeling at the time was enormous in consequence my enjoyment of italian job was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth  still i picked it up used on dvd a few weeks ago and watched it again and i still enjoyed it immensely i have never seen the original though i have heard it is an absolute classic but its modern day counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes  what initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack   imo don davis writes some of the most supple textured and aurally pleasing soundtracks around ij opens with a sly witty pulsing arrangement that combines strings guitar harmonics brush work and quiet moments   it won me over completely from the opening seconds and the whole movie is like this   i havent heard this kind of ringing chiming pulsing soundtrack music since stewart copeland left the police and started doing soundtracks for movies like rumble fish there are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs in here along with some pop song remakes that range from all right to inspired for people to whom the soundtrack is important this movie is a delight  on to the movie i can take or leave mark wahlberg but hes okay here as the leading man and the movie doesnt ask him to do anything he cant do well hes the weakest major actor in the film but thats because the rest of supporting cast is so strong especially donald sutherland in a bit part mos def jason steadham ed norton seth green and charlize theron all turn in solid fat free performances norton seems to mostly be phoning it in rumor has it that he didnt really want to be in the film but hes still a natural even at 1 2 power my one quibble with the casting and acting is with the character wrench who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor his part seems to be shoehorned into the movie and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the late walk on nature of the character if i were a cynical sorti would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a supernumerary role nah never happen production values camera work stunts ploteverything cooks along quite nicely and gray and his production crew pull things together pretty seamlessly with the exception of the wrench character see above  the dialog has a nice light touch that rewards your indulgence and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payoffs along the way my favorite moment   when nortons character tells wahlbergs character that hes just lost the element of surprise wahlberg proceeds to cold cock norton with a right cross and then asks him were you surprised hmmm maybe you had to be there  of course the movie requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief to work but if you just relax and go along with it and dont think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate la traffic via a laptop etc youll have a fun ride  the italian job its lightweight summer fluff but its very good for what it is and it doesnt try to be anything else it isnt good enough for an 8 but id give it a 75,1,1
86,86,i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine it wasnt a highly recommended one by the critic the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands directing and acting were awful i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs although the movie started promisingly it got worse and worse i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters i still think that it is worth watching as i havent seen films subjecting gay porn dont keep your expectations high thoughthen you will be very disappointed * out of *****,0,0,in the year 2000 keep in mind this is two years ago not four two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous piece of art on this side of the mississippi thanks to jere cunningham and tom flynn the world can now enjoy second string a delicious tv movie depicting a tale of a rag tag gang of second stringers thus the title who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters because of the motivational direction of both the director robert lieberman and the buffalo bills last minute qb dan give em hell heller portrayed by canadian actor gil bellows the oft super bowl snake bitten bills find themselves in the ultimate position with an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict a love story comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring and an overall theory that the underdog can compete second string is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on tnt the only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the costume designers first name jenifur jarvis ,1,1
27,27,i would almost give it 10 out of 10 however there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss leading which hurt the flow continuity of the film the story line is great and well composed you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it the characters are complicated and so is the story line expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head its a film where all is explained in the end the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else ive seen in animation it is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so its worth watching it on a good tv or plasma the character voices do save this film in its english version but it would have been more convincing if there were some french accents to emphasize that its happening paris i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitles one the whole its well worth buying on dvd or blueray if they have it and personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like waking life & ghost in a shell 2 innocence this is just a personal suggestion,1,1,the movie is nice well pictured but no originality this movie is directly copied from the hitch where salman plays like a date dr like will smith and govinda like some fat jerk who is desperate to get in love with her boss by the end the movie comes to an old indian flimi style the brides father doesnt like the brides lover and gets some other groom and govinda the brides lover comes in the end and saves her from the new groom and a fancy dance and stuff the comedy was real good no doubt when the hitch meets hindi would be more funnier ultimately worth a watch but when it comes on tv after few months,0,0
135,135,before i explain the alias comment let me say that the desert trail is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges in fact it features carmen laroux as semi  bad girl juanita when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as senorita rita from the classic stooge short saved by the belle  in the desert trail john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard like their stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53  minute movie is moe hitting curly waynes character a skirt chasing bully is not very endearing but is supposed to be the good guy  playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar actually even less after wayne robs the box office no explanation is given for waynes ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl  things get complicated at this point because the villain al ferguson and his sidekick larry fine played by paul fix who would go on to play sheriff micah on televisions the rifleman see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager moe and curly get blamed  so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones who do they meet first but their old friend larry whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest senorita rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie  larrys sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roachs our gang shorts kornman is the main reason to watch the mega lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production as if they used an entirely different crew to film them  even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film  making is staggeringly bad the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground but there is no horse in the frame the film stock is completely different and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider there is liberal use of stock footage in other places none of it even remotely convincing  one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away to screen right from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this not because it is looks stupid which it does but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner they would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background  then again what do i know im only a child,0,1,helen of troy follows the story of helen and the outbreak of the trojan war this is more of a love story between helen and paris who is shipwrecked and falls in love with helen without knowing she is queen the film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together other films and books have different portrayals of the characters but in this one they are simply hopelessly in love the film is pretty slow moving in some places but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well there are also some good performances i thought that the slave girl did a particularly good job and she was one of the most well liked characters overall this is a good adaption if you can look beyond the slow moving story in places and look beyond some of the cheesy romance and dialogue in my opinion a perfect iliad film version has not yet been created but this one is entertaining and does have some good bits,0,1
47,47,fascinating look at fascist italy and the people who carved out a life under mussolini street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching combine this with a masterful plot and premier acting and you get a film that you will want to watch again   and maybe again,1,1,the extraordinarily adorable suzy delair plays a statuesque performer obsessed with succeeding in the theater her husband and accompanist played by bernard blier is a composed but jealous man when he finds out in a less than preferable way that his flashy wife has planned a rendezvous with a lecherous old businessman with the intention of advancing her career he loses all control and threatens the businessman with murder now at that point i must stop describing the film to you because it skates on such thin ice with its twists revelations ambiguities and suspense that to imply any of it would endanger it i am not sure how good or bad that is for this french police procedural emanating from the song  and dance community though it is certainly interesting that what we do know throughout is who did not do it we just dont know who did the story depends upon the procedure of following clues where ideal alibis fail and where cautiously created fabrications and deceptions disintegrate interestingly this is a suspense film in which suspense is generated in spite of the knowledge one would traditionally think too much too soon quay of the goldsmiths is the least dark of henri georges clouzots films its nowhere near as sinister as the shocking les diaboliques as tragic as the riveting wages of fear or as eery as le corbeau maybe it is due to the vibrance of the dance halls and theater settings of 1940s france which all work as the milieu of this crime thriller clouzot both understands and approves of his characters even the more rotten ones where he has more of a vindictive streak with his other films where he may have had understanding for the scheming women in les diabolique or the truck drivers who sink to the level of risking horrible death in order to oust themselves from miserable life in the wages of fear there isnt necessarily support or agreement on the part of the filmmaker for these are characters who plainly made the direct decisions that determine their fate all the characters in this more settling film have scenes and moments that endear us to them even the harsh cold detective played by louis jouvet who worries about his young adoptive son amid all the trouble and despair that happens in his life at any time with the drop of a hat there is humor and unabashed sexiness the latter mostly on the part of delair that neutralize the pressure to a degree clouzot was quietly practicing his craft patient till he made his unrelenting later films in which he would permit his audiences no pardon from the tension,1,0
14,14,the last big thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self desctruction the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at sympathize with which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked best simon geist is a man in his late 30s early 40s who creates a pop culture driven editorial magazine called the next big thing thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitch slap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture his live in female friend darla is also writing a magazine which is real which mainly has to do with her and simon as well as her and her father darla is a genuinely loveable or loathable character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best brent is a flat character with not much to him as is tedra the music video queen for a bunch of b rated rock bands still these characters weave a very interesting web together and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if youre in the indie art house crowd mark my words ,1,1,all right theres no way to sugarcoat this the plot was ridiculous the premise was ridiculous the acting was unconscionable the effects were laughable and all of the outdoor scenes appear to have been filmed in new yorks central park that having been said there was something about this movie that i couldnt walk away from maybe it was the atmosphere or maybe it was the evil super vixen or the amazon wenches anyway im not one to sit on the margins and criticise without pointing out a few redeeming qualities so here they are a violent off shoot of the womens lib movement is portrayed in a wilderness setting central park of course and all of the masochistic young men out there will be very impressed furthermore some of the scenes in which certain characters lose consciousness are amusingly dramatic youll note that i write dramatic rather than convincing all i can say is that some people like b movies and im one of them if youre one of them too then give it a go cheers mr kincaid this is one for the ages,0,0
48,48,okthis movie could have been soooo good all generations have been exposed to thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie the craft themselves and tracey island were realistically transferred to the big screen whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with sophia miles was simply fantastic as lady p and bill paxton whilst not exactly who i envisaged jeff tracey being was solid enoughbut then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines its not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like jonathon frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film it was the fact that alan tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brotherswho were at least 19 20 seriously these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case the film didnt seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical it tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face 3 10 2 for the machines 1 for lady p,0,1,set in hungary in november 1956 this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the uprising once the airport is closed the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to austria as would be obvious they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless yul brynner whose military power as a red army major was marked with loneliness his internal struggle between right and wrong his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings he was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike and he yearned for social contact robert morley plays the quintessential stiff upper lipped englishman who no matter how serious the role manages to maintain an almost light hearted logical outlook on life while jason robards has a stunning movie debut which enforces the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career deborah kerr as the leading lady exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her character the film deals with a very tempestuous time in european history but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great one liners and comedic instances that add to rather than detract from the movie the chemistry in the cat and mouse game between kerr and brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film together all in all a thoroughly engrossing movie which i would definitely watch again 8 10,1,1
120,120,this is cult stuff my friends and i get together once a year to enjoy this movie its very funny and very dry  ive seen this move dozens of times and have yet not to enjoy itthe actors are funny and it gets better with every viewing if you enjoyed morons from out of space you will love this a great play on war of the worlds i love the red neck rampage to get the aliens the bug on the hood the dod the heat seeking populous annihilator the mine field the red camo breaking the speed limit by 1800mph ill get the bucket very funny i would love for this to come out on dvd forget the negative reviews see it for yourself,1,1,the big problem i had with this movie was that lombards character is as another user put it unnecessarily cruel lombard plays the role of ann krausheimer smith who believes she is married to david smith played well by the sharply dressed yet appropriately bumbling robert montgomery the movie has some funny moments especially when montgomerys character goes to great lengths to try to get his wife back understandably she is upset because the marriage is technically not legal but she only finds out three years into it lombards character seems quite cold to her husbands sincere attempts to woo her back while not being highly adept in that effort montgomery is nevertheless visibly loving and yet lombard is as cool as a pillar of ice there are almost no clues suggesting any sort of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the movie and it is hard to see any sort of comedy  even dark comedy  in that aspect to some extent the movie almost suggests a sadistic undertone with lombards character getting a kick out of her husbands feeble efforts while one might consider this another battle of the sexes type of movie the reality is that it is a highly lopsided battle if that montgomerys character while certainly flawed is not flawed enough to make it a typical exemplar of the masculine chauvinist misogynist an excellent example of that is michael douglas in war of the roses in fact the character is largely effeminate as revealed by not only the sharp dress of montgomery which probably owes largely to the perennially sharply dressed actor himself but also to his discomfort in attempting but failing  to play the role of a womanizing bachelor his only major flaw is his vanity but that fault does not balance out with his partners excessive cruelty and there is no suggestion that she is trying to instill any jealousy out of subconscious love this is what makes it so cruel and sad montgomerys character simply looks weak in reality no wife would want a man so weak unless she wears the pants in the marriage but then again a woman who wears the pants in a marriage would never seek to be so cruel because she has already affirmed that role early on hence the whole theme seems weird this movie is neither a champion of feminism lombards character does show some signs of the sort of independent oriented woman of the 60s but that idea is soon quashed and the character falls back into the 1940s nor an even sided battle of the sexes as montgomerys character is truly a cipher of masculinity and therefore a lost cause this movie is on the surface a slapstick but beneath that veneer it is really much darker with sadistic undertones all of which makes its resolution appear well odd maybe that oddity was the whole point in any case slapstick this movie is not,0,1
44,44,perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasnt so attached to the characters in henry fool to those whove never seen henry fool i wouldnt worry as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff the film has lots of exposition and explanations this film is very heavy in plot which keeps the film moving there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartleys trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue over all a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur this film could go either way i have mixed feelings about the film and hartleys later films in general what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other since his late 90s and onward his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter mass media in no such thing religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim i dont know if hartleys talents are suited to such big subject matter or if hes able to do it justice strangely enough the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves the only problem is ive seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel somehow the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henrys books of confessions as a macguffin in the hitchcockian sense fays motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool i guess im slightly disappointed in the film because its not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesnt exactly work as a straight ahead thriller theres too much irony and wryness in hartleys approach to such as big topic as terrorism it somehow works and doesnt work at the same time all i could say you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartleys work and how well you know hartleys work fans of henry fool be severely warned for a disappointment for the rest welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride,1,1,the love letter is one of those movies that could have been really clever but they wasted it focusing on a letter wreaking havoc in a small town the movie has an all star cast with nothing to do tom selleck and alice drummond had so recently co starred in the super hilarious in & out also about an upset in a small town in which they were both great but here they look as though theyre getting drug all over the place i cant tell what the people behind the camera are trying to do here if anything but they sure didnt accomplish anything how tragic that a potential laugh riot got so sorrowfully wasted,0,0
6,6,boy this was one lousy movie while i havent seen all of the burton taylor collaborations i can say with confidence that this is the worst this rich but ill woman taylor of course owns this beautiful island in the meditteranean ruling over a put upon staff when shes suddenly visited by this traveling poet who mouths platitudes in fact the whole film is just a talk fest with much of the talk making no sense even in 1968 no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense and the passage of time makes that even more clear if it werent for the beautiful cinematography and scenery it would deserve a negative rating the only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars,0,0,the plot is simple an american couple is in vacation in thailand somehow they are attacked by the almighty chinese vampires and the girl is kidnapped by the big boss of the vampires this is ok till now the girls partner is left to search for her and now the horror begins he comes upon a strange group of semi vampires or something they only drank animal blood these vampires are in conflict with the bad guy for about800 years however with the help of the good vampires the guy begins to search his girlfriend now the fight scenes begin what a karate movie without fight another thing i have noticed is that the vampires are very ugly guys i meana vampire is an old fashion guyhe is alive sincefor ever hes got style there are also modern vampires but in this movie the vampires areweird like come on they ride a bike they are all dressed in leather and they destroy everything in their way the worst thing is that you can clearly see that this movie it is an low budget one the script is boring and the actors arent too talented the music is pretty good but the effects are not that great to sum up the movie it is not that great but if you have a free afternoon watch it and tell me if im right or not,0,0
92,92,this is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of irish locations if the great mr james had ever come up with a tale this thin    doesnt james in fact have a story called a thin ghost    he wouldnt have bothered to have it published orson welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends this films producers his presence and the one movie industry in joke would have earned this will o the wisp its oscar nomination this is yet more proof if any more were needed that the academy awards have never been any guarantee of merit,0,0,when i saw this film at a festival years ago i was very impressed and i started to looking for it nothing to do not in the cinemas nor on dvd neither on blue ray absolutely nothing how its possible this could really happen the direction is impeccable the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music its perfect and james franco is hot as hell please release this master piece and allow it to have its proper life this is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance  edvard,1,1
23,23,i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s american setting the reason i didnt rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didnt seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer maureens character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because shes a few years older hasnt the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want   if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems like youre going to get youre in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldnt and get killed 7 10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny,1,1,a couple of weeks after i saw this movie it began to remind me of john carpenters in the mouth of madness not for the story for the atmosphere the fast elements of surprise and the dreamlike sequences on the other hand this movie mixes very well the image and the music note the 4th chapter in the movie,1,1
58,58,spoilers wow end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la independence day the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so hes trying to figure out whos receiving the messages and whos also sending out messages in space he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent they visit it everything looks normal including the priest played by a bored christopher lee but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens disguised as priests and nuns they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet once the alien get the special element the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform lee being the last alien left tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens lee walks in the transporter and hes gone the couple looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world decide to follow the aliens because earth is doomed the couple doesnt see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding the end thats it  ive never seen such a dull movie in my life its the most underwhelming movie ive ever experienced the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen they dont care about anything they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide what the heck who needs earth anyway they dont even try to stop them or do something to make things better this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work i wasnt expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production but i didnt expect it to be this bad christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions well im sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining end of the world is much much much worst its beyond dull and inert with no entertainment value whatsoever,0,0,yes this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes over the years the plot lines became over the top melodramatic and very unrealistic however it didnt matter because the show is great you really get involved in the characters and every character no matter how minor or major is perfectly cast i cant imagine anyone else except jk simmons play the neo nazi racist rapist leader nor anyone else playing tobias beecher except lee tergesen the transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is amazing however the character that made oz oz was chris keller played by christopher meloni he didnt have relations with anyone else in prison except beecher well except ronnie barlog but that was only to get ronnie to stop playing around with kellers lover boy beecher their relationship transcended sexes and tom fontana actually made us care about those two and want those two to be together i loved verns soft spot for his kids in the show and how fontana made sympathetic characters out of all these heinous criminals that we grew to adore even simon adebesi  however some plot lines were totally unbelievable and unrealistic * a guy building a bomb in oz * guys standing in a spotlight in their windows in their pods looking at other men plotting something in their mind   too over the top * drugs getting in oz * everyone in the rehab group used or sold drugs and sister pete never helped anyone in six years * people getting killed in the gym supply closet and kitchen * no one hurting ryans mom * no one fighting cyril outside the boxing ring except vern of course * two inmates with tools being left alone in the elevator shaft and one of them dying with no investigation * karl metzger guard gets killed and no one investigates * governor holds all his press conferences at the prison * all an inmate needs to do is say i want to see glenn or i want to see mcmanus and they are taken to them no questions asked * people die every week in oz * on the outside people kill someone and get 20 years up for parole in eight but if they kill someone on the inside they go to death row almost immediately * there is no on site paid staff in the kitchen or mail room   inmates run both departments no questions asked * aging drugs for inmates to substitute as time served * ryan has no friends or associates but he never gets hurt killed maimed raped or beaten * the guys never flush the toilets when they go to the bathroom or throw up * an nba scout comes to the prison to recruit for an nba player yeah right however with all these flaws this show is still awesome its gruesome brutal sexy edgy raw and innovative dean winters scott william winters jk simmons christopher meloni luiz guzman adele the guy that played simon adebisi eammon walker lee tergesen terry kinney mums male alexander ll cool j etc etc etc all are awesome and made the show worth watching  i highly recommend renting this on dvd season six comes out 9 06 next month first five seasons are on dvd   watch them and then watch them again with audio commentary i loved the directors commentary with chazz palmentari the sequence with andy schillinger running down the cafeteria tables and then falling into the hole was an awesome top notch shot kudos and kathy bates directing family business and the famous wrestling scene between beecher and keller   simply amazing brilliant thatd have to be so weird for meloni to touch tergesens private part in front of an icon like kathy bates in that one scene wow pulled that off beautifully pun intended im waiting for oz the next generation like with star trek etc cmon lets get it started,1,1
