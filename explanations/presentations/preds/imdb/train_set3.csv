78,78,i wasnt entirely sure what to expect from a comedy drama fantasy sci fi genre but given the actors involved i thought id give it a spin the tone of the film felt awkward going through patches of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced so eventually i gave up trying and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances which i thought were good on the whole considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story wont give anything away here i have to say it felt a lot longer than its 96 minute runtime and not in a good way in the end i was looking for closure some measure of satisfaction but it didnt turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be i think tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill conceived conclusion ultimately i feel cheated imo it would have been better to let it stand without the ending as a piece of art just or i may have missed the point completely ,0,1,i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me later i found myself lost in the power of the film how do you repay a gift from god the ability of characters to rise above their base natures and respond to the touch from god warmed my heart the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race what more can any film do hollywood i hope your paying attention america does like positive upbeat films,1,1
40,40,this film offers absolutely no imagination in its premise nor in its execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so called comedy that has no energy to speak of story is about nit picky over analytical insurance risk manager reuben feffer ben stiller who finds his new wife lisa debra messing cheating on him with a scuba instructor hank azaria after only one day on their honeymoon upon returning home reuben and his best friend sandy philip seymour hoffman go to a party and run into polly prince jennifer aniston whom they went to school with years earlier *****spoiler alert***** polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who reuben is as a person but they start to date and reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods but one day lisa comes back and wants to remain married to reuben but he really doesnt want to but polly decides to leave as she doesnt believe in marriage to begin with this film is the second directing effort by john hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in zoolander and meet the parents but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel its very easy to say something is not funny but i think with this film its even easier to figure out why this film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if its only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as theres something about mary but instead the events seem incredibly forced did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny if you do your easy a few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesnt work as a comedy or as a romance,0,0,when a group of dumb kids including an unlikable racist bitch stay at an old house it awakens four murderous toltec spirits can lash la rue save the day will you be able to watch until the end due to the horrible comedy on display the dark power is the kind of really bad horror comedy hybrid troma used to release regularly thing is they didnt release this that doesnt excuse the whole thing as it has a dreadful synthesizer score including bad attempts at native american music and even worse comedy music bad make up effects basically halloween masks and atrocious acting ok the fat guy was alright though everyone else is terrible and la rue a western movie vet seems embarrassed to be there not that i blame him really the worst thing though is the comedy aspects sure dumb teens is one thing but when the movie keeps talking about the toltec spirits as if they are the ultimate evil only for them to turn out to be horribly annoying bumbling fools all hope is dashed combining horror and comedy takes at least some skill there is no skill on display here as it all is just stupid and not so dumb its fun either i mean smoking pot and listening to bad punk rock arent i dumb dumb not even a decent ripped off face and a chick in little clothing can save this disaster terrible movie and not even worth a rental,0,0
129,129,in all the comments praising or damning daltons performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a roguish powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite gelled i give this an 8,1,1,im torn about this show while most parts of it i found to be hilarious other parts of it i found to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake the off the wall parody of some of the cartoons are brilliant as indeed are a lot of the scenes with the children however i dont think its clever getting little children to say rude things its not that i think oh poor children theyre being exploited   its just that its really not clever its something that anyone could do therefore making it as simple and pointless as making a paper airplane in order to make this show better they would have to stick to the natural responses from children which i think can be funnier than the scripted at time  by far the funniest part of wonder showzen is clarence the blue puppet who wonders around the streets talking to and annoying strangers its really funny and its mostly improvised seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience test the patience of an extremely patient man was by far the funniest scene in my opinion  you should watch this show though because all in all its very funny even if it is stupid at times,1,0
45,45,magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain pt anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were i just wish that every scene didnt involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display i kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testament i will say that the music by aimee mann was great and ill be looking for the soundtrack cd in short a good movie to look at and listen to the music that is if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been,0,0,this very finely crafted film commits the unforgivable which is ironic given the films theme no one coming into this film knows what they are in for worse than that 3 4 of the way into the film no one still has any clue of what theyre in for because everything up to that moment is a different movie as a front row fan of dutchers first two films easily competing for the best 2 mormon films to date competing with saints and soldiers and now new york doll  saw that at a screening dutcher had me wanting to see his film for a very long time i was there i wanted to believe believe that id see the next great mormon movie one that would hold the numero uno spot for a very long time but no three fourths in the film took the sharpest of left turns and dragged me through something that i never wanted to go through he takes on the mt everest of all moral issues yea both of them with little time or emotional capacity left to adequately address them but instead waves them both off with a nod towards jesus as if that will make all things well instantly true it is that jesus saves dont accuse me of not believing that thats not dutchers problem is the film shot well indeed do the actors act they acted their pants off was the music appropriate all but whatever was over the closing credits everything about this film was superb except the story which was so dank and wrong that all else doesnt matter i learned dank from new york doll very decent show by the way the third act of the film was neither desirable nor pleasant nor faith affirming i know dutcher was bending over backwards to make it so but i was so far shoved out of the movie at that point that nothing no thing could have brought me back the preposterous unbelievability of dozens of details in the final minutes didnt help anyone whos been on a mission knows what im talking about especially anyone whospoiler alertis familiar with events surrounding someone being sent home from a mission early for moral and or psychological reasons its as if a parallel universe suddenly sprung up where normal rules or behaviors suddenly dont apply there are a million things good about this film but they were created and beautified only to be trampled upon and thrown away in a knee jerk fit of ooh this will really get them elitism hence unforgivable i can only hope that when dutcher puts the finishing touches on his next film falling apparently that he remembers that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that its the fans that pay the bills thats why the first gods army was such an unqualified success dutchers shock and awe approach proves that when it comes to the big issues he is in way over his head having neither the spiritual nor creative maturity nor business sense necessary to take them on i prayprayhe learns his lesson and that years from now he and we all look back with a chagrin and rejoice that he pulled his head out of where the light doesnt shine and really successfully takes on those and other issues and changes the world forever because of it,0,1

71,71,`our song gives us the lives of the three teenagers lanisha maria and joycelyn   best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer adolescent summer   even if we dont know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain crown heights brooklyn   is was the same for us all a lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school welcome heat and idleness but if this experience of adolescence is universal the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know   maybe as foreign a country as any young bodies carving new silhouettesbeckoning new territorythe maze towards adulthood the young mind coming into itself speaking for itself saying this is who i am this is who i want to try to be it is was always thus but this is how it plays out in brooklyn in the late 90s jim mckay is the writer director of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him the opening title slide `a film by seems to list everyone in the universe its a gesture but by the end of the film we know it to be a genuine one the closing titles also have some of the most on the money and appreciative credits ive read the vivid sound recording by jan mclaughlin deserves to be especially noted mckays a modest leader who knows who is telling this story   its his three graces lanisha maria and joycelyn theyre the real thing their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality this aint no music video shorthand telling of teenage life it has the seriousness of the long unblinking stare hanging out with them we dont quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in these are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life we are witness to the modern math of teenage life   how its problems are interpreted calculated and summed and solved small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job   its the only way she gets to spend time with him we see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood in a connected scene lanisha defends her dad to her mom and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return later the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams   and we remember how crazy funny kids are and more tragically how realism hammers idealism these days and at the end maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself we see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay she demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable `our songs greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship   how one day alive and enlivening that intimacy can in the next just turn and drift away its awful but thats just the way it is isnt it,1,1,i cannot argue with other comments that the story line focuses more on the romance between the mary martin and allan jones characters much in the manner of showboat than on the life of victor herbert but in the 1930s would that have been a box office draw instead of the life of vh perhaps it should have been the music of vh there is an abundance of this for me the thrill of the movie came near the end of the movie when susanna foster sings land of romance it has been over a decade since i caught this movie for a second time at a local old movies theater at first the audience was stunned then it burst into spontaneous applause i remember the shivers running up and down my spine my trivia memory recalled the information provided to an inquiring public by a local journalist when the movie first came out back in the late 1930s that note hit by miss foster was a far f above high c she may not have had four octaves a la yma sumac but the then teen ager certainly had a range,1,1
60,60,i almost didnt rent this because of all the bad comments but did anywaysi thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas stationthey were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessarythe rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable actingits not the scariest or goriest movie but i wasnt ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and im gonna check them out,1,0,such a highly anticipated remake of a cherished musical classic and such a bitter pill it was to have to take very very hard to swallowall of it it didnt have an ounce of believability anywhere and when you dont have a rose you dont have a show bette midler seemed born to play this part yet all she was able to produce was a cute funny glitzy trademark bette midlerweighed down with all the familiar midlerisms roz russell has nothing to worry about she can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive mama rose of film anyway i thought midler was really going to put it across this timeto throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all timelike she did in the rose but no she played it safe she played herself she made rose a total dinner theatre cartoon even her songs were uninspired it was maddening to watch knowing midler has the talent to rise above her money making schtick she showed promise only once in this gypsy and that was with roses turn but by then it was too little too late a sincere cynthia gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of gypsy outshines that of rose you know theres trouble in river city a huge huge letdown,0,0
42,42,this movie was so bad i dont know whether to laugh or cry i had high hopes for horrorfest that year which was also the first year i attended horrorfest and i have to say horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level mad kudos to the advertisers because im sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year the hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones ive seen the other ones i saw were unrest dark ride and reincarnation the movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which i thought was a rather interesting plot only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some coming of age tale about a boys transition into being a vampire which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film and to make the plot even more ridiculous they add in a set of horny twins who cant wait to take a bite out of one another and some deadly creature locked in the basement which if i had discovered what it was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film i would have left the theater halfway into the movie complete waste of money and time cut forty minutes out of this film and make it into an episode on some show like smallville or charmed or supernatural and it would have received more praise than this absolute rubbish so bad that two years later i have to come back to imdb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies ive ever seen also while youre reading this steer clear from the rest of the horrorfest movies in the future the most you could do is rent them from blockbusters or watch it online somewhere horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who cant make it onto the big screen and all the crap about stuff they dont show you in theaters they werent referring to blood or guts or horrorthey were referring to the movies themselves because theyre horrendous think of horrorfest as a less renowned version of sundance film festival but for horror movies sorry for all the hate but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money,0,0,after kenneth opels rousing story of the invigorated me back into the pleasure of reading during grade school i had high hopes for this series the story of an underdog bat voyaging across country to reunite with his colony captivated my imagination and resonated deeply with my burgeoning imaginationupon hearing of this series i began browsing bardel animations site and liked what i saw the character design looked impressive and the fast paced plot seemed to have been stretched respectably across a thirteen episode arc much was my disappointment then when i decided to watch a rerun early one morn the opening episode shows our hero shade silverwing pursuing a tiger moth in the deep hours of the night chirruping an echolocatory song we see a nifty if crude cgi effect illuminate the moth and the chase takes on a frenetic turn as the tiny insect creates numerous illusory copies of itself do deceive its pursuer as a lover of biology i had a decent understanding of the principles in place tiger moths can sense the sounds their predators use for echolocation and spin a sonic cover for themselves but without such exposition i would have surely been lost a minor quibble i thought surely they director will fill us in momentarily i waited in vain once our protagonist roosts down with some of his fellows we are treated to some of the dullest dialog ive ever seen on television chinook shades childhood rival begin taunting the diminutive hero with the stupidest lines ive ever seen on a show i can understand the writers not producing shakespeare but one would think theyd have had some social contact in their lives   surely enough to make communication seem natural oh how wrong i was the voice acting while not horrendous hardly was a shining example of human achievement oh shade youre broken the law shades mother sighs emptily you must come with me young one croaks frieda the wizened elder of the silverwing colony the actors try but it hardly matters at this point as the story becomes less and less compelling with each pass minute while each episode deals with a problem of the week as is typical of with most television series overarching story arcs pervade the saga for better and worse while the main point of the story is shades reunion with his family later episodes tack on other story arcs involving cannibalistic bats from the southern jungles and a brewing war between birds and beasts the writers try to do too much at once fighting to compress as many promising ideas as possible in the hopes that it will grab audience interest enough to keep the bloody show going on unfortunately these attempts are futile to all but the eight to ten year olds at whom this show is aimed while its nice to see canadian media be perpetuated it would be all the sweeter if the enjoyability of the series wasnt limited to the immediate family of the animators or frothing fans of kenneth oppels books there are worse things out there your children could be watching than silverwing but far better programs are out there too pass on the mediocrity and read the books instead,0,1
87,87,when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5 the acting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best i dont think anyone could have a better job than kate  if it is a rainy day and you cant decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much more if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now you wont regret it ,1,1,this is burt reynoldscitizen kanetragically nothing else he was ever involved in came close to approaching sharkeys machineit seemed to me that he put everything he had into itit is a movie that is in love with moviesthe opening sequence where detective sharkey single handedly rescues a bus load of hostages is an immensely exciting piece of cinema everything moves so quickly once it has started to go wrong that it appears to take on a life of its owna brilliantly achieved effect it looks coldtense and dangerous on mr reynolds streets the precinct house looks dirty and tiredfull of desperate people on both sides of the lawshoutingcursing outtrying to do deals or just stay aliveinto this underworld descends the recently demoted sharkey   a reward for a bungled drugs bustcaused by a corrupt cop   he and his team are part of the vice squadinformation they pick up concerning a crooked politician leads them into the world of high class call girls and ruthless drug barons watching the apartment of one such call girlrachel wardsharkey falls in love with her portrait on the walli knowi knowand when a womans body is found with its face shot off in one of the roomshe thinks its herwelli did say it was a movie that loved movies the scene where she walks in on him works beautifullyeven if you have seen the original the film is full of good touchesi particularly like charles durnings war storysubtly acted and shot in sharp contrast to sharkeys abduction and torture which is suitably harsh and brutal i must mention vittorio gassman and henry silva as two disparate but equally evil brothers with absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever they are full on every time theyre on screen and are no loss to society when their time comesmr silvas end being extra special indeed as has been mentionthis is a clint eastwood movie that clint never madethe biggest compliment i can pay sharkeys machine is to point out that in my opinion clint eastwood couldnt have made a better job of it the soundtrack is of an equally high standardfeaturing sarah vaughanjoe williamsjulie londonchet baker and other top class artists randy crawfords street life plays behind the title sequenceand i can never hear it without in my minds eyeseeing sharkey striding along the sidewalk like other correspondents i have never understood why this film was a bit of a flopi hope it is due for a critical revisionparticularly at a time when so many cop movies and shows without a quarter of its energy  freshness and sheer joie de vivre are lauded from the rooftops if youre ever tempted to think of burt reynolds as a burnt   out one   trick ponyput sharkeys machine in your video machinei promise you wont be disappointed,1,1
108,108,it is a frank zappa axiom that music journalism is people who cant write interviewing people who cant talk for people who cant read if you ever needed proof that musicians cant talk this is the film for you repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices wow thank you idris muhammed this film is pretentious but while much of the pontificating from youssou ndour and his gang of merry men and one token woman grates the music saves the day the main idea behind the film what i take to be the main idea dredged out of the inarticulate commentary is interesting to gather a group of musicians from america and europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery back to their roots in the music of west africa and a concert in the old slave fort of gorée off the coast of senegal we are treated to gospel blues jazz and variations of these including some fantastic drumming both in new orleans and senegal theres also a good deal of ndours own compositions sadly thats another weakness its never entirely clear what ndour himself wants to achieve to some degree the film appears to be an exercise in self promotion on ndours part he wants to play his own music jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires hes clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the curator of the gorée museum the clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places for example somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir but ndour and most of his mates are moslems a point made repeatedly throughout the film the whole early sequence involving the black christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group the only black christians who can hold a tone turn up in dakar at the end of the film to be fair they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film if the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel why not also in the direction of latin america where are the black musical influences from the caribbean and brazil samba reggae then theres europe here the black diaspora doesnt seem to have produced any musicians of calibre since ndour chooses to draft in austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from luxemburg are they in the team just because ndour has played with him before what i personally found most irritating though was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s beatnik black power nation of islam cultural happening in the new york home of amir baraka aka leroi jones hearing people talk about the importance of knowing your history and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance why do so many african americans believe that taking an arabic name is an assertion of their african roots and why do they think arabic islam is so much more admirable than european christianity who do they think established the trade in african slaves in the first place the film doesnt have much to say about the situation in west africa today beyond the platitude that present conditions are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for 300 years the senegalese appear to be a poor but happy musical gifted folk friendly and welcoming respectful of their elders and not above fleecing the visiting americans in the fish market is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination there is no comment on the armed guard that ndour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of dakar there is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from dakar came from dakar the similarity between the folk drumming style of new orleans and the folk drumming style of senegal is cited in evidence the last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland bidding them farewell except of course that by and large the slaves shipped from dakar did not come from dakar they were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever european power currently held the gorée slave fort the people of dakar are not the descendents of africans who escaped the slave trade they are just as likely  more likely  to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile the two agendas clash again in the final part of the film there are two separate endings on the one hand the concert which ndour and co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the gorée slave fort the other end comes when the harmony harmoneers sing the spiritual return to glory in the seaward doorway of the slave fort this is deeply moving even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears this is a film that is flawed unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions irritating confusing beautiful and emotional by turns watch it listen to it for the music and the feeling but dont expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour,0,0,this was a very good 1950s western one of the better ones ive seen in a decade which featured that genre on screen and on tv it certainly had three big actors on the marquee glenn ford barbara stanwyck and edward g robinson it turns out that ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles ford had the bulk of the dialog he also was the good guy while robinson was the bad guy and stanwyck was twice as bad as robinson she played the real heavy in this film and the character she played was a little too contradictory at times  ford handled his starring status very ably as he usually did   especially in westerns he played a nice guy who didnt want to fight was a peaceful manbut if you pushed himlook out the story had a nice mixture of action and lulls not overdoing either it had an expansive western setting which was put to good use with the cineamascope widescreen it also featured realistic people in a realistic setting that credibility with the characters especially the supporting players was most impressive the men way out shined the women in this film acting and character wise dianne foster and may wynn were weak   the only negatives of the production its easy to see why these two actresses never became stars even though it is over 50 years old this western is one youd still find fast enough moving to enjoy no matter how old you are or what youre used to seeing for classic film fans this is almost a must with this cast and good story highly recommended,1,1
9,9,theres enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent fascist regime bad open mindedness good racism bad etc unfortunately were battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as ive described them  ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling match jeremy irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close as her sister in law when the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable unfortunately the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets we dont get to know them hence we dont get to care for them the result is boredom  if bille august the director and screenwriter from isabel allendes book had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely as it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfest not recommended,0,0,this was the worst wrestlemania in history the only good matches were ricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez and the tag title match between the british bulldogs and the dream team this one bordered on classic everything else was either poor or awful the idea of having three host cities was unnecessary confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show the celebrity guests were terrible on commentary especially susan saint james if youre interested in the mid 80s wwf youre better renting or buying wrestlemania 3 or just about any other ppv for that matter,0,0
93,93,it was one of those late night its there i saw it things sometimes they are great this one was awful but it really shouldnt have been the movie had a really good cast how can you fail when you have charlsten heston and jack pallance were talking oscar winner turf here it had good special effects it even had some really good tits and i mean nicely shown full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver but it didnt compensate for the one missing ingredient   a story the plot was ludicrous i dont mean the solar crisis sun exploding stuff but that was bad enough it was the rest of the stuff   the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff man that just stank no amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that one i have seen the same cast members be incredibly good i have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets all the difference is in the writing,0,0,i loved this thing the most wonderful thing about pink flamingos is that it strives desperately to be in horrible taste but has really gained a cult following world wide says a lot about us us being people doesnt it pink flamingos succeeds because waters made the film he wanted to make a film need not be disgusting to succeed but it may be when you watch this film you see things that are disgusting but are ultimately brilliant because they are freely displayed what we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression everyone who ever cares to succeed as an artist be it in film or any other media should watch this film,1,1
134,134,i was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a swedish film with subtitles however i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images   although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes a traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias discrimination and sanctimonious pretence an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen,1,1,it is real easy to toast roast flay and otherwise burn this film for all of its abundant flaws it was made by high school students and faculty and a whole community it shows sure i could examine the script which is just ridiculous a monster created from the garbage of a growing californian city starts eating garbage and taking garbage cans all over the city soon this huge beast with wings no less begins to destroy buildings and even plays the beauty and the beast act with a young high school girl fortunately for her there is a gang of guys her former boyfriend nicknamed the penguin and the town drunk out to help her the direction is awful the production values just dreadful the acting non existent and the pace sluggish the movie is hard to sit through   period however that being said it is also a miracle of a film when you consider that this thing was crafted by an entire community you can see all the collective effort from the actors the actual mayor and actual firemen and policemen to the area location shots used i also was really amazed at all the local businesses credited at the films end with helping to finance or contribute in some way to the film when you look at the film from that perspective it is indeed quite an achievement i didnt know anything about it before i sat down and watched it now that i have found out something about it i am impressed but make no mistake   i have nonodesire to sit through it again,0,0

18,18,can only be described as awful it is bad to start with and then gets even more bad when you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse   but fear not because it does another poorly written script for a donkey director for no talent offspring of past movie stars its hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both as for the hero   well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it and in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes 20ft onto concrete   doesnt even blink   then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies this is a really ridiculous movie lucky it only cost me $1 to hire,0,0,i once lived in the up and let me tell you what i didnt have the foggyest idea what the heck this bear walk  is i never heard of it the whole 10 years i was up there it was really funny in the beginning but went down hill quickly,0,0
115,115,i was so excited when i discovered this was available i couldnt wait to see it what a waste of energy its kind of like that rarities cd by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery but once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album this dvd is only recommended for completionists who must have everything lynch has done six men getting sick is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive it lacks the power of lynchs later work the grandmother is quite simply an immature work its tedious and looks like a student film but it was the 70sits interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director but you can see briefly the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds the alpahabet is forgettable no really i cant remember this one at all the amputee is pointless the cowboy and the frenchman is just plain silly lumiere is the only worthwhile one in the bunch without dialog lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work i had to watch this one several times but it runs less than 2 minutes hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the dvd,0,0,a ham actor without a penny who better than michael caine to play such a character he is totally and utterly hilarious but as in most of caines performances he goes for it for real the film seems to be a showcase of dylan moran and hes splendiferous in his double act with caine this however is where the script falters morans impersonations should have been incorporated in a rather more organic way they are too much of an act on their own and makes the potential plausibility of the plot fly out of the window never mind get it if you can find it there is enough in it to make it a pleasurable journey,1,0
132,132,just another example of why stepehn kings books should not be made into movies even carrie one of the best is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen the premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer always on a diet who accidentally kills an old gypsy woman in court with the help of the judge and the local police chief he gets off even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3 with our main character billy the lawyer getting thinner and thinner by the day though the movie kept with the book for the most part and has your typical king ending the acting was stilted and felt forced we went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between sort of like reading acts in a play king himself made a cameo in the movie sort of like dave barry which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that authors leave the acting to actors not that anyone in this movie was that great ive seen the major characters in movies where they were much better,0,0,i have seen this movie just once and im looking forward to see it again and again dear david from beligium why did you bother to write a comment on this movie i only think we can think about you after reading you comment is that youre provably a non sexual person like erika in the movie and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up i guess you are a bit old and sexual expression is not part of your visage the cannes film festival is by far the best movie festival and im is my pleasure to say that this film was awarded with best actress best actor and grand prix isabelle huppert is magnificent as always who would do this movie like her one of her best performances ever the music is fantastic and once more michael haneke puts reality in the big screen its like a dogma95 kind of movie because of the topic try to see it ,1,0
133,133,tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years no grant character transformations no hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic the balance in speed in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied the fact that this film is about nothing merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining it is brilliant because it is empty in between the lines it is happening to see or not to see thats the ,1,1,ed wood rides again the fact that this movie was made should give any young aspiring film maker hope any screenplay you might have thought of using to line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of tylenol or rolaids watching this movie made me realize that boa vs python was not that bad after all it probably would have been better to do this movie in claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film it is understandable why this director has so many aliases there is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to make your toward your tv sets cocoon of cheese that surrounds it,0,0
90,90,why didnt this pick up a bag full of oscars it is an amazing interpretaion of an oft filmed performed piece the visuals are breathtaking especially in wide screenthe pan & scan really kills this films wonderful cinematography and sets every frame is a painting astounding the play is almost completely intact and branaghs passion for it is clear from the opening titles on no zefferelli here just great storytelling the way only film can but rarely does jacobi is especially perfect as hamlets murderous uncle he doesnt play him as a mustache  curling evil villian but a charming politician allowing us to see why only hamlet suspects foul play branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between hamlets fake real madness and the burning revenge inside him and the many cameos come off quite well everyone from billy crystal and robin williams to gerard depardeu and charlton heston unobtrusive if you are sucked into branaghs vision the way i was a mesmerizing piece,1,1,normally i am a typical creepy crawly hatin girl but after watching this film on youtube of course im having different perspectives and also i did not know that my favorite animation studio   fleischers made another film thats about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans lighted cigars and cigarette buttsfootstepsetc and how a plucky young grasshopper named hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of honey the bee i love the lovely ms honey you know after watching the film the bugs reminded me of the some of the jitter bugs from don bulths thumbelina and out of the songs in the film i love were a couple in the castle when i sing that song it almost made me cry this wonderful film was the second and final feature to come out of the fleischer studio the film was originally going to be released on november of 1941 but since the fleischers rival disney released dumbo weeks earlier paramount changed the date to december of the same year but mr bug unfortunately went into a then unrealized trap of terrible timing having the misfortune of opening two days after the attack on pearl harbor mr bug was a financial disaster and led to the ousting of max and dave fleischer from the studio they had established in 1919 and reorganized the company as famous studios another huge factor in their departure was the fact that max and dave fleischer were no longer speaking to one another due to disputes how sad it was overall i love both films from the fleischer bros   gulliver and mr bug,1,1
68,68,despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved apart from a clichés only plot the movie is let down by some weak acting accents and overall lack of tension whilst having the overall look of a big budget for nz the feel is decidedly small town kiwi has anyone not seen the brothers   http  imdbcom title tt0250274   those who have will pick the similarities straightawayive heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd boys talking crap but it comes across as forced i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious those who have any doubts left at all that samoans living in nz culture has been deeply  hopefully not permanently affected by american speech  culture and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie robbie magasiva always looks good on screen  but is let down by the script it always rubs me up the wrong way when a comedy has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline   see the wanna be white boy i know someone who found this movie hilarious  however that person has the brains of a tadpole and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick  ok but not great  fun but not funnywake up nz   this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing middle class white guilt     reviews my advice  if you watch it get drunk first,0,0,this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen i gave it one star simply because it is the lowest score possible whoever thought flood would ever be a good film the director and cast should be ashamed and then it dawned on me this could all be part of a shambolic scare tactic only propaganda could be this bad the redeeming feature of flood is that its ghastliness and shameless formulaic storyline make it funny if only the characters had the same depth as created by the flood itself yet they galumph from sound bite to sound bite without any emotional response whatsoever the sad thing about this film is that it could have been so much better informative imaginative and tense flood has the amateur streak to found in many recent british films where a more focused use of funds would have made for a better entertainment where was smithee,0,0

102,102,actually goldie hawn is from washington takoma park maryland but i digress this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn the story is interesting but its highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shots life it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh possible spoiler ahead it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up and the speech she made at the endbeautiful too bad not many people have guts like that in real life,1,1,adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by hollywood for his softball user friendly movie making techniques tim burton tipped the scales too far in formulas favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend sleepy hollow following the quest of ichabod crane  played by johnny depp delivering this dreary films only shining point  to the heart of the mystery surrounding a towns seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable contrived as a childrens bedtime story humdrum character introduction is laced with intended upon exciting non engaging chase scenes which with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives produce about as much fright and thrill as the nightmare before christmas toss in an endless bundle of old trees for ambience and a wide eyed big busted blonde love interest christina reechi and burton has himself a movie that takes the age old legend of sleepy hollow and succeeded in making it like a disney movie without the charm or captivation dialog was choppy and ridiculous severed heads were aplenty and there were enough plot revealing monologues to embarrass the likes of james bond even with the backing of emmanuel lubezki the most sought after cinematographer in hollywood today the wonderful acting of depp and burtons astounding name recognition sleepy hollow is nothing to lose your head over,0,0

12,12,finally an iranian film that is not made by majidi kiarostami or the makhmalbafs this is a non documentary an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the system in its ass its all about football and its funny its really funny the director says the places are real the event is real and so are the characters and the extras this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness the non actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a your heart is made of stone b you are blind excellently scripted the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness it has won the jury grand prize berlin 2006 dear reader its near perfect where where can i get hold of it,1,1,what ho this one is jolly good i say jolly good ol chap or should i say ol bean my mastery of british terminology is a little dusty anyway my biker boots and i walked into this screening with no prior viewing experience of wallace and gromit im happy to say that my boots and i walked out pleased to have made their acquaintance while not as adult accessible as toy story w & g still manages to be clever enough to provide the grown ups with a little humor that will most definitely soar over the heads of the young uns who are too busy guffawing at the were rabbits belches to have any clue that something is amiss i highly suggest that you pay close attention any time you see books or words on the screen because there are quick glimpses of puns that youll miss if you arent paying attention my favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the loch ness monster as tourist trappus if youve ever been known to say i can really relate to kevin federline or if youre just illiterate then not only will you miss out on these jokes but you probably should be spending your time learning to read instead of going to movies consider this a public service announcement the most impressive aspect about w & g is its clay animation thanks to the tedious process it took five years to finish the film according to the press notes there were some days when the optimum goal was to merely accomplish 10 seconds of completed film folks i sometimes have trouble finding the motivation to finish responding to a handful of emails or adding captions to pictures for my reviews a point that is proved by a lack of pictures in this review so i cant even imagine having the required patience for that i really like the rough hands on quality of the claymation figures the fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice personal touch how can you not be impressed with clay characters that show more expression and emotion than paul walker and keanu reeves combined the curse of the were rabbit is as director nick park calls it the worlds first vegetarian horror movie that should entertain both kids and adults alike relying on and as a male who prides himself in his shaggy haired cool bearded masculinity i hesitate to use this word cute and oh man i probably shouldnt use this word either lovable characters rather than outdated mc hammer references w & g is proof that dreamworks can create entertaining animation when it chooses cleverness over the cheap joke,1,1
