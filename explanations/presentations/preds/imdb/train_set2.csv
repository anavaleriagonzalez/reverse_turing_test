5,5,there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring just a notch above lowbrow thanks to freeman and spacey who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as justin timberlakes acting i hate to knock the guy but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte the better the movie isnt all badjust mostly i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man he deserves it and unlike his fellow musician and co star he can act kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of tenhes not that good when all is said and done the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters all in all ts just plain boring that being said rent this when you are suffering from insomnia,0,0,or at least forceable retirement this movie is awful horrible terrible rank rotten putrid well you get the idea do not under any circumstances watch this piece of decaying garbage unless you have a death wish because its sure to kill you i only survived because i missed the first half hour carrot top is a bad comedian and an even worse actor i cannot believe he got anyone to fund this huge waste of time and money it just goes to show that some people have no scruples if they think they might make a buck or two literally i cant imagine this made more than $2 and someone please tell me what possible motivation courtney thorne smith a halfway decent actress certainly above this at any rate had for signing onto this steaming pile of dung was she that bored during that 35 second dry spell between melrose place and ally mcbeal or did she owe some kind of karmic debt to the most annoying person on the face of the planet aka carrot top i give this a 2 10 and thats probably way too high i try to save my 1s for movies that make me vomit and since i didnt see all of this one my stomach contents thankfully stayed contained i dont think ill be watching it again to find out if its really worth a 1,0,0
76,76,this has to be the funniest stand up comedy i have ever seen eddie izzard is a genius he picks in brits americans and everyone in between his style is completely natural and completely hilarious i doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a** off watch enjoy its funny,1,1,a very very very slow moving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man not sure who was more lost   the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out  attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed   became even more ridiculous   as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non existent very little music or anything to speak of the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head he goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales clerks before they find the album cute scene gave promise but it went downhill from there the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty wasted two hours,0,0
74,74,in what will probably find itself on my list of fullers best movies that is once i see more of them that just this and shock corridor pickup on south street is a film noir where the femme fatale as well as the male protagonist are not the stereotypical ones in the genre like most of his other works fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of new york style that is usually absent in the hollywood noirs on a small budget  at least for the likes of darryl f zanuck  fuller and his actors create personas that are likable even in such a dark atmosphere the good guys are basically the ones who wont get violent with you even as theyre looking for an extra buck  richard widmark jean peters and thelma ritter are all terrific in the lead parts widmark is one only a few actors i can think of who couldve really pulled off this character hes a little like bugs bunny as he can be a wise ass who is a little sneaky on the other hand the character of skip mccoy does have a set of values in his life he doesnt go into other peoples affairs and doesnt try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river after being sent away for three years he slips up unbeknownst to him when he pickpockets a woman peters on the train and lifts an item thats under the eye of the government it may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money but at what cost is the centerpiece of the film as it involves stoolie moe ritter is one of the finest and most believable character actors from the period the womans ex a volatile kiley and the police department aside from the thematic elements which are told with a keen dramatic journalistic style as was fullers previous position along with boxer the dialog is fresh and involving theres a spontaneity in many of fullers camera moves and what a third act this is a lean tight film noir that is worth checking out even if youre not familiar with fuller its comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works,1,1,whatever you do dont stop watching when you think the movie is over hang around for the first batch of credits or youll really miss something we saw this movie at the savanaah film festival and thought it was the best of the bunch dreya weber is a marvel really not only because of her performance but because she can pull it off so far above the ground at the q&a she said there were no wires or effects so everything you see is really her going for it addie couldnt make it to the festival because she was dancing with madonna she was excellent and my gawd so beautiful i was amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd but there you have it savannnah isnt a backwater,1,1
64,64,no hidden agenda pure scifi all fun i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad i was a kid  the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten the original one starring the great movie star steve mcqueen bullet is by far the better and only version anyone should see the movie production is dated but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord 10 10  zafoid,1,1,tragic hero is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic godfather films focusing on family crime loyalty and revenge also this is part of a two part series as the godfather also was at the time however this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other triad thrillers being released in hong kong at the time one reason is the acting with the exception of chow yun fat the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable the audience tends to find the proceedings humorous simply because the actors inability to maintain any degree of seriousness as a result we find the film not truly emotionally involving or intense since we dont particularly care what occurs with these characters another reason is its lack of focus the narrative tries to incorporate many different story elements into the film but this results in portions of the movie becoming underdeveloped as well as lacking any real sense of coherency the audience sometimes becomes lost at the proceedings we are viewing not knowing what the characters motivations are the films climax does contain a decent gun fight but again since we dont care about the characters we dont care who lives or who dies the scene loses its intensity and suspense because of this the other action set pieces are rather mundane in nature with a feeling of it being too controlled rather than free flowing in general this is a strictly average film and isnt recommended to the general film viewer only hard core genre enthusiasts and fans of chow yun fat should consider this film for viewing,0,1
67,67,read my lips sur mes lèvres which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope the two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos who ive never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel who has brought a sexy and or threatening look and voice to some us movies the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and hes the neophyte the second half is on his turf as an ex con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu writer director jacques audiard very cleverly uses the womans isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so its even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as sensory reactors as well none of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that pliable victim from in the company of men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake outs  there is a side story thats thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths this is one of my favorites of the year  originally written 7 28 2002,1,1,in this 4th childs play film chucky gets lucky its very funny and there are some enjoyable parts very good direction not as bad as it could be the best one in the series since the first three stars out of four,1,1
119,119,the japenese sense of pacing editing and musical score must be different than american tastes but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production work someone in hollywood needs to re make this movie and i think it would be a big hit the story is interesting and creepy theres something about the edges of the city gritty policemen earthquakes sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating however this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter i do have to say that the sixth sense effect was in full force in this movie and that was evident from the very beginning as it stands only the die hard japanese film lovers should bother seeing this oh so boring movie,0,0,as horror films go rest stop could have been better in many levels director writer john shiban shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it unfortunately either he was not sure as to what to do with the material or maybe he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended either by the studio or the backers several endings have been included in the dvd but unfortunately the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best the idea of a psycho roaming the back roads of a remote part of california presents many possibilities at first after the disappearance of jess in the spooky rest stop things get out of hand poor nicole is left alone to fend for herself all the weirdos she finds along the way it was clear when one started to hear amazing grace in the background that there were forces trying to avenge the ways in which nicole an jess desecrate their neck of the woods by engaging in careless sex that is not well appreciated by the natives watch it at your own risk theres a lot of gore for the aficionados of the genre,0,0
88,88,airport 77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings & such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens james stewart who is flying them & a bunch of vips to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum also on board is stevens daughter julie kathleen quinlan & her son the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid air the plane is hi jacked by the co pilot chambers robert foxworth & his two accomplices banker monte markham & wilson michael pataki who knock the passengers & crew out with sleeping gas they plan to steal the valuable cargo & land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean & loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle with air in short supply water leaking in & having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivors as they await help with time fast running out also known under the slightly different tile airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash hit disaster thriller airport 1970 was directed by jerry jameson & while once again like its predecessors i cant say airport 77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best just it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid air hi jacking & then the crashing didnt he see the oil rig & sinking of the 747 maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure 1972 & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & its a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic characters dull dialogue lethargic set pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & theres not as much urgency as i thought there should have been even when the navy become involved things dont pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but theres just something lacking here george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background the home video & theatrical version of airport 77 run 108 minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni flashbacks to flesh out characters longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport 77 as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects arent great either along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie awards hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon thats a little harsh the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly the production values are alright if nothing spectacular the acting isnt great two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this one time oscar winner james stewart looks old & frail also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too airport 77 is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far & i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly the production & bland direction doesnt help though & a film about a sunken plane just shouldnt be this boring or lethargic followed by the concorde  airport 79 1979,0,1,footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize psychological thriller is the most appropriate description i can think of the female protagonist alice cespi discovers that she doesnt remember anything of the last three days the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel she is also haunted by a recurring very vivid dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago in her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesnt trust anyone but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before this is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold and particularly how it will end the unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well the important part of the one and only nicoletta elmi everyones all time favorite redheaded obnoxious child star of italian horror is an extra bonus,1,1
94,94,spoiler alert this movie zero day gives an inside to the lives of two students andre and calvin who feel resentment and hatred for anyone and anything associated with there school they go on a series of self thought out missions all leading up to the huge mission which is zero day zero days contents are not specified until the middle to the end of the movie the viewer knows its serious and filled with hate but is never quite sure until the end now we all know if the movie is based on the columbine massacre the ending is pretty obvious and the ending is no different than any other movie about the attack they go and kill many of their fellow students in the end i have seen a lot of movies on this attack and this movie by far is my favorite and most respected it gives the viewer and inside look to the lives of these two teens who hate life and honestly it gives the viewer some what of an understanding and a closure on the horrible event being only 7 when the events played out i never knew the seriousness of the shootings until my english class was assigned an essay or story on a defining moment in our generation well i knew everyone was going to pick the twin towers but i wanted to be different because of course the twin towers was tragic and very defining but i didnt think it was the right choice for me because there was really no way of relating to that because i was only in the 3rd grade and i had no idea what it all meant but the shootings did leave and effect i remember the interviews the sky views of the school and the hurt and terror in the eyes of thousands of people this movie is a compelling down to earth and horrific masterpiece and i would reccomened it to anyone,1,1,some janapese modern horror movies are very good strong plot scary moments good acting while others are just unfortunately uzumaki belongs to the latter camp i will rate the movie based on 3 elements plot scary factor and acting 1 plot   true to the name the movie the plot moves in circle and never really explains itself ok the town is captivated by the spiral curse but why and why do people act so foolishly there is a fleeting attempt to explain about what is happening by the reporter unforutunately 2 scary factor   if this was meant to be a horror flick it has failed miserably i cant really remember one good scary scene with plenty of build up to it  3 acting   very monotonous people walking around saying meaningless phases i cant really feel much empathy for our tragic heroes all in all there are much better modern japanese horror movies out there with coherent plot and strong characterization dont bother wasting your time on this wannabe,0,1

59,59,revenge of the sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series the only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow  and i mean slow  build up to what we know will be the birth of darth vader and when that finally comes its pretty all right not great not even good but pretty all right this movie is being vastly over praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels instead its just turgid dull and routine but you have to say wow those cgi environments are really impressive at times bu the lightsabre fights theyre all a blurry mess i think the dark side took hold of lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed this will make a ton of money but thank god its over this once worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough i saw the 1201 show and after it i heard a group of very small kids say wow that was awesome but everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing i fell asleep in the middle it was kind of boring i just thought seeing the birth of darth vader would be better so said we all,0,0,did uwe boll seriously just rip off the basic idea and dialogue from se7en why is it so fekking difficult for this douchebag to be original he even mentioned in an interview with gametrailers that he chooses stuff like games to make into movies because the characters plots backstories and so on are already there and ready for him to screw with guess it isnt too much of a stretch for him to rip off another movie entirely i mean seriously what the hell heres something i made in uwes honor http  zuuckadeviantartcom art uwe boll is a douchebag 70369862,0,0
52,52,well i guess ill have to be the one to say the emperor has no clothes when i saw this show listed for pbs last night i was both hopeful and apprehensive i loved morse even going so far as to buy the complete dvd set and felt that while i always liked kevin whatelys sgt lewis character the show was john thaw period after watching the new inspector lewis as it is billed here i am more convinced then ever that i was rightwhately is fine even though he looks awful both badly aged and too fat but he simply doesnt have the charisma to carry the show as did thaw and as for his sidekick fox wellperhaps the reviewers here from england can understand what hes saying but i for one mostly could not as for ms innocentall i can say is that i miss james grout im sorry to say that they should have left morse rest in peace,0,0,hayao miyazakis magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser ponyo on the cliff by the sea his latest animated film which turns on the usual sweetness to charm your socks off i thought that the trailer featured its song which was quietly hypnotic and i didnt have to wait for an invite to make sure i got my ticket for the sneak preview of the movie scheduled to open here next week for fans of studio ghibli films youll probably know what youre in for as miyazaki has yet another winner in his filmography that will win new fans over im embarrassed to say the least that ive so far watched only my neighbour totoro eyes that pile of ghibli dvds and love it to bits but i guess this would serve as a final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated films that i would enjoy ponyo voiced by nara yuria is a magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea with her constant forays in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a peek nonetheless these ambitions do not bode well with her humanoid dad fujimoto tokoro joji who harbours some hatred toward the human race for pollution and briefly touching a subplot on environmental protection   revenge by mother nature as well an accident one day sees ponyo being washed ashore and picked up by five year old boy sosuke doi hiroki who lives on a house on the said cliff with his mother lisa yamaguchi tomoko while dad koichi nagashima kazushige is mostly out to sea since hes a sailor and you can expect some moments of throwback to the likes of the little mermaid or splash made for kids saying anything more would be to spoil the fun the artwork here is still simply astounding even though its in 2d glory knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked on there are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame that youll probably be game for repeated viewings just to spot them all this definitely beats any 3d or cg animated production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity and not only from the artwork department but on its story too despite complaints coming in that it took a leaf from the hans christian andersen classic while there are avenues to make this film extremely dark it only suggested certain dark themes but opted instead for a film with more positive emotions suitable for both kids and adults alike at its core its about love that between the family members of koichi lisa and sosuke and especially between mother and son more so its about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened ponyo and i tell you ponyo herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of bolt walle and eve all hands down characterization here is top notch and its hard not to fall in love with ponyo in whichever form adopted especially when shes such a playful being who doesnt hide her emotions   if shes upset with you either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a definite shoo in to my top films of this year without hesitation and the next time i go to tokyo im sure as hell going to make my way to the ghibli museum to bask under the magical world brought to us by hayao miyazaki highly recommended film so dont you go missing this on the big screen,1,1

128,128,this movie is a farce names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast and they have the gall to give beowulf a ridiculous cannon crossbow weapon beowulf doesnt need a weapon like that in the poem he rips off grendels arm with his bare hands and i cant believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing the way grendel is portrayed is impressive however that and the cast are the only positive points of the feature my english teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination unless you are a die hard fan of the epic poem beowulf avoid this film at all costs and even then i wouldnt recommend it,0,0,my girlfriend and i are really into cheesy horror flicks especially ones with lots of unnecessary nudity when we saw the box cover for this movie at blockbuster we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night we began watching it already not expecting it to be great but thought it would at least catch our interest 20 minutes into the movie we realized that the pace would not eventually pick up and that it was an incredibly boring movie we tried to get into it but the plot made very little sense even after reading the back of the dvd box over and over again the film was shot very dark and it was pretty annoying to try to figure out what was going on in each shot each violent scenes were very hard to make out and you never get to actually watch the violence youre expecting this is definitely a film without motive that was shot poorly and very drawn out each scene was about 20 minute of the same thing and i felt i got the point after the first 5 skip this film and re watch another freddy or jason flick and youll be way more content,0,0

13,13,there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick stahl obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible amber benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was 80 minutes which is too short for a good movie but too long for this onethere are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters dont spend the time on this one,0,0,this should have been a short film nothing more the length of 15 hours is much too long because after 10 minutes you have seen almost every joke its getting more and more on your nerves untill you finally kick out your brain to endure that movie to do yourself a favor dont mention to see that movie,0,0
62,62,very dull obvious tedious exorcist rip off featuring a doberman with red eyes   thats the extent of the special effects in this made for tv cheapie richard crenna is about as animate as a chew toy very 70s dress & music only add to the torture should put you to sleep almost as fast as the corpse vanishes or the blue hand practically worthless moocow says eaghhh what a stinky dog =8p,0,0,postwar england the dawn of the atomic age yet the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience his first kiss cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as the bomb this was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and his world of the 1940s free of political correctness and preachy messages this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind and hormones of a young teenager can create wonderful subplots maintain character interest ala gregorys girl and plenty of well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era this is a very good story for anyone young or old who has ever been in love or ever wanted to be does he ever get his wish watch it and see,1,1
65,65,you think youve had it tough you should check out this film carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination what this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an inspiration to us all and significantly after seeing this film i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it cuba gooding jr does some of his best work to date as brashear de niro as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him george tillman in only his second major feature after soul food has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker if you want to be moved and inspired you definitely need to check out this one,1,1,i watched cold mountain and the english patient again this weekend the former is a civil war melodrama about inman jude law a confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to ada monroe nicole kidman a girl he barely knows both films were lovingly directed by anthony minghella who does an exceptional job although cold mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy backwoods dialog romantic epics need a convincing heroine the english patient had kristin scott thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart alluring and beautiful katherine clifton the main problem with cold mountain is ada who seems silly and dim witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that inman could become obsessed after one kiss as an actress kidman has a limited range she usually plays stern faced women who face adversity with stoicism kidman was also too old to play the ingénue and laws love interest the film needed a young actress who could play charming warm and vulnerable for someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well fed and over dressed kidman was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made up for each scene michele pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly even natalie portman would have been an improvement renee zelleweger was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for kidman jude law was in his own silent movie in the odysseus role but played his part well ray winstone was excellent as the london southern villain during the civil war people were probably not very well educated by todays standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables however if you watch bbc adaptations of dickens austen or mrs gaskill everyone is articulate maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment,1,1
101,101,i read one other review that expressed the view that platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people being killed taking drugs and talking trash i dont agree with that because the film actually had more to it but it a way i can see what this person is trying to say this had no real plot   which is a point i agree with it is self indulgent stone at his best he really wanted to show not only how war leads to death but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive unfortunately the film seems to over glorify this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne grand standing oscar hunting lets create an enduring image for my liking the problem i have with stone and other film makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is does not prove or even reflect on whether it was an unjust or immoral war we have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with iraq in case youre missing the point let me put it to you bluntly if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers would you think it was an unjust war if that fact alone doesnt convince you that it was an unjust war then why should depictions of the horrors of vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance  personally i do not support americas decision to go to war in vietnam but i certainly dont subscribe to the this war is wrong because people died and suffered theory i dont think that motivations are always wrong by default just because war in itself is terrible this says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big twist was a bit stupid however this is not stones first oddball departure wall street was a magnificent film up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful wrong turn jfk is probably one of the few films stone did that actually ended very well but it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around and this is why i gave it such a low mark it was virtually story less and ultimately boring   unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy,0,0,i turned over to this film in the middle of the night and very nearly skipped right passed it it was only because there was nothing else on that i decided to watch it in the end i thought it was great an interesting storyline good characters a clever script and brilliant directing makes this a fine film to sit down and watch this was in fact the first id heard of this movie but i would have been happy to have paid money to see this at the cinema my imdb rating  8 out of 10 ,1,1
137,137,expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine boy was i wrong ill start with what is right with this movie at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh and its due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle room to do his thing hes an undoubtedly talented individual and its a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be in my opinion a total train wreck with that out of the way ill discuss what went horrifyingly wrong the film begins with dan burns a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column he prepares his girls for a family reunion where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other the family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie no family behaves like this its almost as if theyve been transported from pleasantville or leave it to beaver they are a caricature of what we think a family is when were 7 it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating touch football crossword puzzle competitions family bowling and talent shows are not how actual people behave its almost sickening another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for observing her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet i left the theater wondering what i just saw after thinking further i dont think it was much,0,0,im warning you    this movie is not scary if youre a horror movie fan especially a childs play fan youll think its incredibly funny but you wont be scared its not a bad movie but its not scary,1,1
89,89,this movie is a great way for the series to finally end peter the boy from puppet master iii is all grown up and is now the puppet master well this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulons secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii puppet master iii puppet master 4 puppet master 5 curse of the puppet master and retro puppet master sorry but i guess paramount wouldnt let them use scenes from 1 personally i wish puppet master vs demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say this is the final movie in the series,1,1,co directed by and starring rutger hauer this film short was based on a short story by dutch writer harry murlisch in the 10 minutes of the films length you will get to see a life time as harry unravels his long time fascination with a room he passes constantly in his youth returning to the city many years later he finds he has rented the same room using black and white film the textures are accentuated in this delicate telling of a tale the voice of harry drawing you into his world a subtle tight performance from rutger hauer and 2 non speaking characters wonderful soundtrack by dutch musician dyzack at the moment difficult to see this movie as it is only available on dvd region 2 linfidele liv ullman as a bonus track but is due to be on the re released dvd of the hitcher   another tight but very different performance from hauer see this film if you can,1,1
57,57,upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it the acting is stunningly wonderful the characters are very clearly drawn brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana all in all this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s you must see this movie ,1,1,i saw this on sale   new   at my local store for $6 and said hey an action film with that guy from bloodsport and enter the dragon directed by the guy who did enter the dragon   and its cheap so i bought it oops this is possibly the worst film ive ever seen and ive seen some doozies you know how movies which are intentionally campy like evil dead ii and dead alive are awesome you know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again like lionheart an old van damme film or john carpenters vampires are pretty cool this film ironheart manages to be neither of those i dont know what the filmmakers were thinking but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot no budget for anything and no script to speak of while im on the script note i should point out that bolo yeung has no lines in this movie   the only reason he gets first billing on the box is the fact that hes the only actor in the film that youll ever recognize unless youre a jackie chan fan in which case youll recognize the bad guy   and youll want to call him giancarlo whats also sad is that this film is from 92 by that time t2 judgment day had come out so you know that the era of 80s campiness was over but not quite after this youll think 80s chuck norris films high school comedies and jason freddy sequels were works of sheer genius  things to know 1 nobody in this film can act for beans the closest you get is richard norton looking appropriately rich and cocky and bolo yeung looking appropriately mean  and cocky everything else is dreadful 2 the martial arts scenes are forgettable   just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking off their shirts yelling running at britton lee getting kicked by britton lee getting punched by britton lee then falling down even the final showdown against bolo is disappointingly short and about as creative as the design of my running socks and equally stinky 3 the rest of the action is pathetic too the guns look like they came from the toy department at k mart and indeed they fire with the sound of a capgun when someone gets shot they bounce around a little bit then lie still with splotches of brownish red liquid on their clothes britton lee apparently gets shot in the side but you dont see it at all then later that day you see the wound  ive had paper cuts that were worse than that 4 of course then the girl dresses the wound then they kiss then next thing you know theyre lying in bed talking after sex huh what believable development of the love interest as well as any kind of character development at all are overlooked completely in this film remember how bruce lees characters didnt need to have sex with anybody to be cool 5 the car chase is by far the worst ive ever seen it looks like the director was sitting on the curb with a hand held camera as the two cars weaved down the road doing oh i dont know about 30 miles an hour dont try this at home kids these people are professionals hah 6 really bad writing heres a scene for you lee is being followed so the girl follows the followers to warn lee but her car is too slow so by the time she catches up lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and theres a gunfight in progress lee has killed two bad guys but the third is shooting at lee when the girl almost runs lee over so the bad guy runs away huh then the girls car stalls and she cant start it she tells lee shes involved now and shes coming with him he points out to her that they cant leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her she somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem   so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car and remember later that same night they have sex huh 7 if you look closely in more than half of the nightclub shots the dancers are very much out of sync with the music the dancers are also all way too co ordinated with each other apparently in the 80s all people at dance clubs took dancing lessons there is a girl in the dj booth with a microphone but she never does anything except dance the bouncers tell people who are fighting to take it outside   without moving their lips in one scene the only bouncers lee and stevo pass by are just inside the entrance but with their backs to it also apparently if youre a major character in the film you can go straight to the head of the line 8 lee notices the first time he is being followed but he doesnt notice the second time   even though its the same guy in the same car the girl however notices bad guys get followed twice but they never notice 9 lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girls car back to her even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice the girl proceeds to leave her child at work in the care of a friend while she is off having sex with lee do not learn parenting from this film cant think of more gripes right now  you get the idea  ironheart is so bad it aint even funny its sad,0,0
69,69,this is one of my favorite sports movies dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him as a high school coach he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them hell try out for a baseball team if they do they win partly because of all the batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch over 90 miles an hour and he keeps his side of the bargain  and is signed  if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult jim morriss story will resonate with you it is moving and inspiring and the mans relationships ring true  inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one though dennis quaid is just downright purdy in the part and a baseball movie with a good looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven ladies if you feel the way i do check this one out,1,1,strange often effective hippie zombie flick starring the unforgettable husband wife team of alan and anya ornsby this movie isnt as bad as most in its genre but is still way high on the cheese factor includes several bargain basement zombies outrageously campy dialogue a scene chewing performance by alan ormsby several gay kinky grave robbers and one straange soundtrack wife anya puts on a performance thats so odd one has to wonder if shes really acting at all there are much worst pics of this kind during the era look for any al adamson flic but its no night of the living dead director writer benjamin clark is really bob clark who went on to create the purile porkys early 80s teen exploitation disasters he has only now resurfaced after 1 inexplicably good movie a christmas story to return to his dreadful ways with baby geniuses weirdo alan ormsby later wrote the kinky nastasia kinski malcolm mcdowell version of cat people moocow says check this hippy horror movie out for fun zombie frolics and campy dialogue =8,0,0
114,114,what happened what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never really got going there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it steve martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot,0,0,okay this may not be the most sophisticated movie youll ever see actually there isnt a bit of sophisticatedlyness* in it its puerile adolescent inoffensive idioticand utterly hilarious basically richie and eddie run the worst hotel in britain cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up try to get the rent money out of the only resident who is daft enough to stay have an all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next doorand fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press give it a try if youre a fan of rik and ade and their work if youre notdont get the movie simple as that *im not being thick this is a word from another one of riks fab jaunts into the movie world ^_^,1,0
