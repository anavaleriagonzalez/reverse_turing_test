23,23,i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s american setting the reason i didnt rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didnt seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer maureens character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because shes a few years older hasnt the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want   if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems like youre going to get youre in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldnt and get killed 7 10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny,1,1,a couple of weeks after i saw this movie it began to remind me of john carpenters in the mouth of madness not for the story for the atmosphere the fast elements of surprise and the dreamlike sequences on the other hand this movie mixes very well the image and the music note the 4th chapter in the movie,1,1
68,68,despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved apart from a clichés only plot the movie is let down by some weak acting accents and overall lack of tension whilst having the overall look of a big budget for nz the feel is decidedly small town kiwi has anyone not seen the brothers   http  imdbcom title tt0250274   those who have will pick the similarities straightawayive heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd boys talking crap but it comes across as forced i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious those who have any doubts left at all that samoans living in nz culture has been deeply  hopefully not permanently affected by american speech  culture and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie robbie magasiva always looks good on screen  but is let down by the script it always rubs me up the wrong way when a comedy has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline   see the wanna be white boy i know someone who found this movie hilarious  however that person has the brains of a tadpole and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick  ok but not great  fun but not funnywake up nz   this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing middle class white guilt     reviews my advice  if you watch it get drunk first,0,0,this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen i gave it one star simply because it is the lowest score possible whoever thought flood would ever be a good film the director and cast should be ashamed and then it dawned on me this could all be part of a shambolic scare tactic only propaganda could be this bad the redeeming feature of flood is that its ghastliness and shameless formulaic storyline make it funny if only the characters had the same depth as created by the flood itself yet they galumph from sound bite to sound bite without any emotional response whatsoever the sad thing about this film is that it could have been so much better informative imaginative and tense flood has the amateur streak to found in many recent british films where a more focused use of funds would have made for a better entertainment where was smithee,0,0
25,25,i was electrified when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984 steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten i didnt when finally in south africa in 1993 it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel iafrika my hair stood on its ends there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples,1,1,this classic has so many great one liners and unintentionally hilarious scenes that i dont even know where to start if you want advice on dating its here just totally ignore the person you want and then spout out classic lines like chickens goodi like chicken and before you know it you will be having a one nighter in a basement its a nice basement with a woman who is 35 years younger than you bronson does it all in this film he buys a car for no good reason just so he can murder two gang memberspaying with cashchunnng he buys an ice cream simply because this is america isnt it and ends up wasting someone named the giggler   he laughs when he runs just because he stole his camera by the way this giggler is so fast that bronsons regular pistol cant even catch up to him he needs to order a special one just to get this elusive creep he gets cleaned up just so he can eat a really smelly meal stuffed cabbage in a rat trap with a couple of old people who like to wear heavy clothing in 90 degree weather he goes into the dentistry business he always seems to find a crow bar when he needs one and its the same one and last but not least he always seems to have a rocket launcher at his disposal just in case he needs to blow away richie cunninghams older brother chuck who is now strung out and in dire need of a makeover anyway this will all make sense once you have seen this classicall i can say is enjoy i owed you that one dude,1,0
65,65,you think youve had it tough you should check out this film carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination what this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an inspiration to us all and significantly after seeing this film i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it cuba gooding jr does some of his best work to date as brashear de niro as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him george tillman in only his second major feature after soul food has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker if you want to be moved and inspired you definitely need to check out this one,1,1,i watched cold mountain and the english patient again this weekend the former is a civil war melodrama about inman jude law a confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to ada monroe nicole kidman a girl he barely knows both films were lovingly directed by anthony minghella who does an exceptional job although cold mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy backwoods dialog romantic epics need a convincing heroine the english patient had kristin scott thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart alluring and beautiful katherine clifton the main problem with cold mountain is ada who seems silly and dim witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that inman could become obsessed after one kiss as an actress kidman has a limited range she usually plays stern faced women who face adversity with stoicism kidman was also too old to play the ingénue and laws love interest the film needed a young actress who could play charming warm and vulnerable for someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well fed and over dressed kidman was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made up for each scene michele pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly even natalie portman would have been an improvement renee zelleweger was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for kidman jude law was in his own silent movie in the odysseus role but played his part well ray winstone was excellent as the london southern villain during the civil war people were probably not very well educated by todays standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables however if you watch bbc adaptations of dickens austen or mrs gaskill everyone is articulate maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment,1,1
24,24,getting lost in space frozen for 15 years thats unlikely falling into a star improbable falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes ludicrous getting rescued by a ship just then priceless no its not zaphod beeblebroxs heart of gold to the rescue its also not the parent of the year awardees after sentencing her daughter to two years solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man theyve picked up this foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat which makes up most of the films action combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away who obligingly simpers in the line of fire in the end the family of three abandons the metropolis sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave instead using the psychos fighter ship which theyve refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 07 kiloton missile you have to love those hard sci fi statistics  as long as hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill theyll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the sci fi channel,0,0,i suppose im supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt these laboratory movies and yes they spend a lot of time in the laboratory always fail in one dimension there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time of course they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that dr frankensteins did there is always something they didnt anticipate there are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that dont work here the young woman is certainly fetching and the doctor cant help himself but he could have been a little bit discreet or even made an effort to shelter what he was doing things go wrong and because of this intellect she gains tremendous power including an understanding of how she came to be rock hudson looks pretty fit here he never quite makes it in this role however it wanders all over with lots of clichés and silliness which diminishes the basic issue once she has her revenge a more suitable thing would be for her to wander off and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some grand way,0,0
15,15,slow and riddled with inaccuracy over looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the alamo during the texas fight for independence from mexico james arness as jim bowie brian keith as davy crockett alec baldwin as col travis raul julia as general santa anna this made for tv project also stars david ogden stiers kathleen york and jim metzler very good original music by peter bernstein,0,0,without john rhys davies i have to admit that this would never even register on my movie meter but in spite of that single fact this is not a bad little thriller considering the low budget the low quality effects the stiff acting and the sci fi channel aspects the blood effects are very convincing and the chupacabra actually looks realistic regardless of what you think a chupacabra looks like this is one good looking chupacabra aside from the positives this runs kind of like kolchak the night stalker darren mcgavin remember meets the love boat but in spite of the ultimate cheese of this work it still holds something resembling a plot and actually attempts to gain your respect while making you laugh and roll your eyes as conflicted as this work is i still managed to find some enjoyment herein maybe you will too it rates a 52 10 on the made 4 tv scale it rates a 41 10 on the movie scale from the fiend ,0,0
3,3,i have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me i cannot understand why some people compare this to babe this film is not about the secret life of all animals who secretly can talk instead it is about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner a little girl with a serious stammer overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart wrenching scene early on then the great journey begins paulie the parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend marie along the way he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people he falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her he gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him he recounts his tale to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved marie tony shaloub shines as the kindly janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little paulie despite the risks jay mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across there is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too it is a witty clever epic animal adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl he search for marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who dont know much about parrots kids who have seen the wild green parrot tribes in los angeles and pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds especially parrots are not disposable pets all children everywhere will see that pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured so no babe here more of an incredible journey with a twist enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts,1,1,i saw this movie on a flukei was standing on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this moviei gave it a chance not expecting muchthe promotional movie posters ive seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all the movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metalill leave it therethe movie is a heavy comedy and lots of funif your are old enough to remember when heavy metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this filmjack black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician tenacious d is definitely worth a look,1,1
9,9,theres enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent fascist regime bad open mindedness good racism bad etc unfortunately were battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as ive described them  ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling match jeremy irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close as her sister in law when the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable unfortunately the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets we dont get to know them hence we dont get to care for them the result is boredom  if bille august the director and screenwriter from isabel allendes book had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely as it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfest not recommended,0,0,this was the worst wrestlemania in history the only good matches were ricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez and the tag title match between the british bulldogs and the dream team this one bordered on classic everything else was either poor or awful the idea of having three host cities was unnecessary confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show the celebrity guests were terrible on commentary especially susan saint james if youre interested in the mid 80s wwf youre better renting or buying wrestlemania 3 or just about any other ppv for that matter,0,0
5,5,there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring just a notch above lowbrow thanks to freeman and spacey who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as justin timberlakes acting i hate to knock the guy but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte the better the movie isnt all badjust mostly i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man he deserves it and unlike his fellow musician and co star he can act kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of tenhes not that good when all is said and done the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters all in all ts just plain boring that being said rent this when you are suffering from insomnia,0,0,or at least forceable retirement this movie is awful horrible terrible rank rotten putrid well you get the idea do not under any circumstances watch this piece of decaying garbage unless you have a death wish because its sure to kill you i only survived because i missed the first half hour carrot top is a bad comedian and an even worse actor i cannot believe he got anyone to fund this huge waste of time and money it just goes to show that some people have no scruples if they think they might make a buck or two literally i cant imagine this made more than $2 and someone please tell me what possible motivation courtney thorne smith a halfway decent actress certainly above this at any rate had for signing onto this steaming pile of dung was she that bored during that 35 second dry spell between melrose place and ally mcbeal or did she owe some kind of karmic debt to the most annoying person on the face of the planet aka carrot top i give this a 2 10 and thats probably way too high i try to save my 1s for movies that make me vomit and since i didnt see all of this one my stomach contents thankfully stayed contained i dont think ill be watching it again to find out if its really worth a 1,0,0
77,77,how does an usual day start in point place wisconsin first of all red the tyrannical father of the forman family and a wwii veteran sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife kitty serves breakfast then comes their skinny son eric he sits at the table as well and his father starts his daily yelling usually involving placing his foot in erics behind if insert reason here if his promiscuous angel faced sister laurie is at home she comes along then red stops yelling and kindly talks to her making eric feel left out of the family once this daily painful ritual is over eric rushes down to his basement where all his friends are already hanging out and when we get to see them it becomes obvious eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend next door neighbor and childhood friend donna pinciotti are the sanest people around meet steven hyde the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and doesnt really care about whats around as long as its not funny to watch michael kelso the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through his life only by his looks and that carrots grow in trees jackie burkhardt the one who thinks of herself as the prettiest girl around spoiled kid of a rich father and of course cheerleader and fez a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and cant keep a secret at first they simply hang out gossiping and making fun of kelso but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin before going out doing something theyll regret later meanwhile red goes out and meets donnas weirdo parents bob and midge hes rude but they dont mind as they think hes joking somewhere around is leo an aging hippie whos constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing did you imagine that seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters of course most seem clichéd but the show takes the cliché to a new level now throw in some of the most wicked story lines a sitcom can offer sit down and enjoy one of the best tv shows ever the one that never does two times the same thing and which is compared to most sitcoms that are cute funny purely hysterical if you get hooked dont let this show let you go bite on the hook over and over and man you will see the sitcom genre from a whole new prospective,1,1,this is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is what is shown is the incredible poverty in sicily as the 19th century gave way to the 20th a life style that made people dream of the new world of america the mancuso family live in a place that is not even a hamlet just a stone cottage set amid the harsh unyielding stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass an opening sequence sees the mancuso males scrambling barefoot up a craggy hillside stones in their mouth to offer at a shrine at the top in exchange for a sign that they should set out for the new world or remain where they are it further shows life aboard the liner huddled masses indeed yearning to breathe free and conditions in ellis island where their journey still not over they are interrogated and examined to prove their fitness to enter america what is not shown is the ship in longshot or indeed any shot that would identify it as a large ocean going liner what is also not shown is anything that would identify america no cliché view of new york harbour and the statue of liberty so that ellis island could be anywhere in any country perhaps the most remarkable shot is the one from a camera crane looking down on hundreds of people jammed together slowly almost imperceptibly two thirds of the people at screen left begin to separate from the third at screen right and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are on the dock a powerful statement of society being fragmented theres a strong documentary feel throughout as though we were following an actual ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an amalgam of typical families conditions at the time with almost nothing happening in dramatic terms its not for the popcorn brigade at the multiplex but for the rest of us its a very fine film indeed,1,1
