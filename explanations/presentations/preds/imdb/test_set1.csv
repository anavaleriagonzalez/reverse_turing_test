56,56,im easily entertained i enjoyed hot shots and the naked gun and their many sequels even when most people found them unbearable ive even managed to enjoy most pauly shore movies there is only one movie that ive seen that i can honestly say was badand this was it its been a while since ive seen it but i do remember sitting in the theater thinking this is a dumb movie why did i see this its honestly the only movie that i cannot recommend,0,0,journey to the far side of the sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun which shares the same orbit as earth and therefore has been undiscovered until a space probe on the far side of the sun photographs it of course two astronauts roy thinnes & ian hendry are sent to explore it but due to a malfunction they crash & find themselves back on earth only 3 weeks into their six week journey of course theyre berated at least thinnes is hendry is gravely injured and grilled and asked why they turned back on their mission but its claimed that they didnt until thinnes seems to notice a few very odd things about being back home this is excellent if somewhat talky at times and the sets and feel arent a far cry from thunderbirds territory but will live actors for once its no big star wars type production but more quiet science fiction that one has to think about a bit well worth seeing and its criminal that the dvd is out of print 8 out of 10,1,1
26,26,a bit slow and boring the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman the brothers sitting on the porch the wealthy cigar smoking man the photography of the river is marvelous as is the interior period decoration if you like decoration of banana republic stores this is a must,1,1,wow i picked this off the rental shelf because i loved robert carlyle and jonny lee miller in trainspotting this is a phenomenal movie it has action romance suspense intrigue and wit when i wasnt laughing i was at the edge of my seat this is definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century this film has everything to keep me happy,1,1
31,31,i have heard about this novel a long time ago many of my friends have recommend me to read it i searched it in every place and finally found it this is a book that every man should read because it is genius and because of its vision i enjoyed every page i knew about the movie and could not wait to see it when i finally did i was very disappointed many things that are in the book are not in the movie i do not think that this is a spoiler that just makes the movie not logical michael radford might be a good director but a bad writer especially as a book adopter the movie is not dark at all the writing is really bad the only thing that is good even great is the acting john hurt is an amazing actor and the only face i myself could see as winston smith what angers me the most are the people in imdb that called this the best adaptation ever without even reading the book or knowing anything about screen writing you can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book do not consider this as an alternative as a fan of the book i was very disappointed the points i gave for this movie goes for the acting,0,0,superbly crafted low budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as well the cast play it very well although richards self centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times the tiny two scene cameo by sir alec guinness oozing menace as the crime czar of moscow is simply the icing on the cake well worth repeated viewing but not on dark nights when youre all alone,1,1
60,60,i almost didnt rent this because of all the bad comments but did anywaysi thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas stationthey were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessarythe rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable actingits not the scariest or goriest movie but i wasnt ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and im gonna check them out,1,0,such a highly anticipated remake of a cherished musical classic and such a bitter pill it was to have to take very very hard to swallowall of it it didnt have an ounce of believability anywhere and when you dont have a rose you dont have a show bette midler seemed born to play this part yet all she was able to produce was a cute funny glitzy trademark bette midlerweighed down with all the familiar midlerisms roz russell has nothing to worry about she can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive mama rose of film anyway i thought midler was really going to put it across this timeto throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all timelike she did in the rose but no she played it safe she played herself she made rose a total dinner theatre cartoon even her songs were uninspired it was maddening to watch knowing midler has the talent to rise above her money making schtick she showed promise only once in this gypsy and that was with roses turn but by then it was too little too late a sincere cynthia gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of gypsy outshines that of rose you know theres trouble in river city a huge huge letdown,0,0
49,49,simply terrible why wouldnt you use actual actors look this has to stop stop using non actors if you want any credibility or any message sent via these low budget filmsplease for the love of god use real actors most will work for freetake advantage of that now back to my commentanyway the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasnt funny on any level as for the qualityin one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crewguess what it was one guy with what looked like a sony camcorder and probably not even his well i assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetishand it wasnt even good gore,0,0,pot seeking pre teen joshua miller as tim throws his sisters doll into the river while daniel roebuck as samson howls and smokes a cigarette after killing danyi deats as jamie the doll washes away but the naked young woman stays by the rivers edge for any passerby to see viewing the dead body are a group of twenty something teenagers mostly classmates of the naked corpse stoners keanu reeves as matt and crispin glover as layne are found most camera worthy the friends wonder what to do about their guilty beer guzzling killer friend veteran in the cast dennis hopper as feck keeps the youngsters heads fed mr hopper once killed a woman he lives with one of those life sized sex dolls with a mouth apparently ready for action ione skye leitch as clarissa is a more living doll and she is waiting for reeves to kiss her their copulation is notably cross cut with a flashback to the opening strangulation an actual teenager in her first feature role ms leitch is the daughter of sixties singer donovan make other quirky connections on your own you can read a lot into the movie or not depending on your mood some of the characters backgrounds may be a little too subtle most obviously the killer teen was teased note his weight attitude and toilet connected nickname some of the characters relationships and motivations are too vaguely defined but the cast certainly keeps the material interesting and director tim hunter photographer frederick elmes and writer neal jimenez are obviously skilled ******* rivers edge 8 27 86 tim hunter ~ keanu reeves crispin glover dennis hopper joshua miller,1,0
69,69,this is one of my favorite sports movies dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him as a high school coach he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them hell try out for a baseball team if they do they win partly because of all the batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch over 90 miles an hour and he keeps his side of the bargain  and is signed  if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult jim morriss story will resonate with you it is moving and inspiring and the mans relationships ring true  inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one though dennis quaid is just downright purdy in the part and a baseball movie with a good looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven ladies if you feel the way i do check this one out,1,1,strange often effective hippie zombie flick starring the unforgettable husband wife team of alan and anya ornsby this movie isnt as bad as most in its genre but is still way high on the cheese factor includes several bargain basement zombies outrageously campy dialogue a scene chewing performance by alan ormsby several gay kinky grave robbers and one straange soundtrack wife anya puts on a performance thats so odd one has to wonder if shes really acting at all there are much worst pics of this kind during the era look for any al adamson flic but its no night of the living dead director writer benjamin clark is really bob clark who went on to create the purile porkys early 80s teen exploitation disasters he has only now resurfaced after 1 inexplicably good movie a christmas story to return to his dreadful ways with baby geniuses weirdo alan ormsby later wrote the kinky nastasia kinski malcolm mcdowell version of cat people moocow says check this hippy horror movie out for fun zombie frolics and campy dialogue =8,0,0
40,40,this film offers absolutely no imagination in its premise nor in its execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so called comedy that has no energy to speak of story is about nit picky over analytical insurance risk manager reuben feffer ben stiller who finds his new wife lisa debra messing cheating on him with a scuba instructor hank azaria after only one day on their honeymoon upon returning home reuben and his best friend sandy philip seymour hoffman go to a party and run into polly prince jennifer aniston whom they went to school with years earlier *****spoiler alert***** polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who reuben is as a person but they start to date and reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods but one day lisa comes back and wants to remain married to reuben but he really doesnt want to but polly decides to leave as she doesnt believe in marriage to begin with this film is the second directing effort by john hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in zoolander and meet the parents but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel its very easy to say something is not funny but i think with this film its even easier to figure out why this film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if its only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as theres something about mary but instead the events seem incredibly forced did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny if you do your easy a few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesnt work as a comedy or as a romance,0,0,when a group of dumb kids including an unlikable racist bitch stay at an old house it awakens four murderous toltec spirits can lash la rue save the day will you be able to watch until the end due to the horrible comedy on display the dark power is the kind of really bad horror comedy hybrid troma used to release regularly thing is they didnt release this that doesnt excuse the whole thing as it has a dreadful synthesizer score including bad attempts at native american music and even worse comedy music bad make up effects basically halloween masks and atrocious acting ok the fat guy was alright though everyone else is terrible and la rue a western movie vet seems embarrassed to be there not that i blame him really the worst thing though is the comedy aspects sure dumb teens is one thing but when the movie keeps talking about the toltec spirits as if they are the ultimate evil only for them to turn out to be horribly annoying bumbling fools all hope is dashed combining horror and comedy takes at least some skill there is no skill on display here as it all is just stupid and not so dumb its fun either i mean smoking pot and listening to bad punk rock arent i dumb dumb not even a decent ripped off face and a chick in little clothing can save this disaster terrible movie and not even worth a rental,0,0
44,44,perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasnt so attached to the characters in henry fool to those whove never seen henry fool i wouldnt worry as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff the film has lots of exposition and explanations this film is very heavy in plot which keeps the film moving there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartleys trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue over all a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur this film could go either way i have mixed feelings about the film and hartleys later films in general what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other since his late 90s and onward his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter mass media in no such thing religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim i dont know if hartleys talents are suited to such big subject matter or if hes able to do it justice strangely enough the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves the only problem is ive seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel somehow the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henrys books of confessions as a macguffin in the hitchcockian sense fays motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool i guess im slightly disappointed in the film because its not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesnt exactly work as a straight ahead thriller theres too much irony and wryness in hartleys approach to such as big topic as terrorism it somehow works and doesnt work at the same time all i could say you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartleys work and how well you know hartleys work fans of henry fool be severely warned for a disappointment for the rest welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride,1,1,the love letter is one of those movies that could have been really clever but they wasted it focusing on a letter wreaking havoc in a small town the movie has an all star cast with nothing to do tom selleck and alice drummond had so recently co starred in the super hilarious in & out also about an upset in a small town in which they were both great but here they look as though theyre getting drug all over the place i cant tell what the people behind the camera are trying to do here if anything but they sure didnt accomplish anything how tragic that a potential laugh riot got so sorrowfully wasted,0,0
0,0,forbidden siren is based upon the siren 2 playstation 2 so many 2s game like most video game turned movies i would say the majority dont translate into a different medium really well and that goes for this one too painfully theres a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer leo morimoto and his children daughter yuki yui ichikawa and son hideo jun nishiyama come to move into the villagers dont look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the siren on the island to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing naturally and slowly things start to go bump and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants but in truth you will not bother with whats going on as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more what was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill placed out of the norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity until its explained much later its one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered despite it clocking in under 90 minutes   i think its a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark   it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes but its a classic case of too little too late what saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience it turned out rather satisfactorily but leaves a bad aftertaste as youll feel cheated somewhat there are two ways a twist will make you feel   it either elevates the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling unfortunately forbidden siren belonged more to the latter the saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but i will be that explicit   its still not worth the time so better to avoid this,0,0,you know im sure the boys were sitting around the office one day and said how can we make more money they had made every possible variant of toy they could make with their current characters so they decide lets steal the star wars idea a prequel and we can make up all new characters and sell them as toys incidently something they did in puppet master 3 but who cares anyway they pick a point in time before the first movie when toulon is still alive he and the puppets are sitting around and a wooden head roll on the floor and the puppets want to know if that is a dead family member or something it doesnt matter so the tale of the puppet master ancestry begins its long its boring no body cares the funniest part is they tell the origin of these new characters in the movie but give no clues of their fate so guess what once the revenue from the new toys pays off they can fundsa new and 4th straight rotten sequel called puppet master 8 the sequel to the prequel of the fate of the dead retro puppets hold your breath,0,0
57,57,upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it the acting is stunningly wonderful the characters are very clearly drawn brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana all in all this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s you must see this movie ,1,1,i saw this on sale   new   at my local store for $6 and said hey an action film with that guy from bloodsport and enter the dragon directed by the guy who did enter the dragon   and its cheap so i bought it oops this is possibly the worst film ive ever seen and ive seen some doozies you know how movies which are intentionally campy like evil dead ii and dead alive are awesome you know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again like lionheart an old van damme film or john carpenters vampires are pretty cool this film ironheart manages to be neither of those i dont know what the filmmakers were thinking but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot no budget for anything and no script to speak of while im on the script note i should point out that bolo yeung has no lines in this movie   the only reason he gets first billing on the box is the fact that hes the only actor in the film that youll ever recognize unless youre a jackie chan fan in which case youll recognize the bad guy   and youll want to call him giancarlo whats also sad is that this film is from 92 by that time t2 judgment day had come out so you know that the era of 80s campiness was over but not quite after this youll think 80s chuck norris films high school comedies and jason freddy sequels were works of sheer genius  things to know 1 nobody in this film can act for beans the closest you get is richard norton looking appropriately rich and cocky and bolo yeung looking appropriately mean  and cocky everything else is dreadful 2 the martial arts scenes are forgettable   just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking off their shirts yelling running at britton lee getting kicked by britton lee getting punched by britton lee then falling down even the final showdown against bolo is disappointingly short and about as creative as the design of my running socks and equally stinky 3 the rest of the action is pathetic too the guns look like they came from the toy department at k mart and indeed they fire with the sound of a capgun when someone gets shot they bounce around a little bit then lie still with splotches of brownish red liquid on their clothes britton lee apparently gets shot in the side but you dont see it at all then later that day you see the wound  ive had paper cuts that were worse than that 4 of course then the girl dresses the wound then they kiss then next thing you know theyre lying in bed talking after sex huh what believable development of the love interest as well as any kind of character development at all are overlooked completely in this film remember how bruce lees characters didnt need to have sex with anybody to be cool 5 the car chase is by far the worst ive ever seen it looks like the director was sitting on the curb with a hand held camera as the two cars weaved down the road doing oh i dont know about 30 miles an hour dont try this at home kids these people are professionals hah 6 really bad writing heres a scene for you lee is being followed so the girl follows the followers to warn lee but her car is too slow so by the time she catches up lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and theres a gunfight in progress lee has killed two bad guys but the third is shooting at lee when the girl almost runs lee over so the bad guy runs away huh then the girls car stalls and she cant start it she tells lee shes involved now and shes coming with him he points out to her that they cant leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her she somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem   so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car and remember later that same night they have sex huh 7 if you look closely in more than half of the nightclub shots the dancers are very much out of sync with the music the dancers are also all way too co ordinated with each other apparently in the 80s all people at dance clubs took dancing lessons there is a girl in the dj booth with a microphone but she never does anything except dance the bouncers tell people who are fighting to take it outside   without moving their lips in one scene the only bouncers lee and stevo pass by are just inside the entrance but with their backs to it also apparently if youre a major character in the film you can go straight to the head of the line 8 lee notices the first time he is being followed but he doesnt notice the second time   even though its the same guy in the same car the girl however notices bad guys get followed twice but they never notice 9 lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girls car back to her even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice the girl proceeds to leave her child at work in the care of a friend while she is off having sex with lee do not learn parenting from this film cant think of more gripes right now  you get the idea  ironheart is so bad it aint even funny its sad,0,0
